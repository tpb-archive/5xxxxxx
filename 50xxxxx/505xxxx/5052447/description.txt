Release Date: 14 August 2009
Release Length: 01:54:44
Storyline: It's the year 2035, and the community now has the help of robots. 
These robots have three laws integrated into their system. One, they cannot harm a human being or, through 
inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Two, they must do whatever they're told by a human being as 
long as such orders don't conflict with law one. Three, they have to defend themselves as long as such defense 
doesn't conflict with laws one or two. One day, the writer of the three laws, Alfred Lanning, apparently 
jumps out of the tenth-floor window of U.S. Robotics. The majority of the Chicago Police Department believe 
that he committed suicide, but Detective Del Spooner, who hates robots, thinks he was murdered, and the 
number one suspect is a Nestor Class-5 robot who calls himself Sonny. However, if it was Sonny, then that 
means he would've had to have broken the three laws. With the help of Dr. Susan Calvin, Spooner must now 
discover the truth before it's too late.
