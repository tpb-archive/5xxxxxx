*If the Doors had only recordered their debut album they would still have been  **
*assured a place in rock and roll history. Released in 1967 the album sounds    **
*just as fresh and exciting today as it did then. A mix of blues, rock and jazz,**
*together with the voice and lyrics of Jim Morrison made the album one of the   **
*greatest debut albums of all time. 						**
*										**
*By the use of interviews, musical demonstration, rare archive footage and live **
*performances, the program tells the story behind the conception and recording  **
*of this groundbreaking album. The surviving members of the Doors share their   **
*memories of the bands early days, the making of this album, and throw essential**
*light onto living with the lyrical genius Jim Morrison.			**
*										**
*With musical demonstrations from Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger and John Densmore **
*we hear some of the elements that went into creating the unique sound of the   **
*Doors.										**
*										**
*In exclusive interviews the leading players in this story add insight to the 	**
*Doors as musicians, composers and leaders of a generation. These include 	**
*manager Bill Siddons, friend and Beat Poet Michael McClure and Jac Holzman who	**
*signed them to Elektra Records. Further insight is provided by musicians Henry **
*Rollins, Perry Farrell, legendary Los Angeles DJ Jim Ladd, fellow film student **
*Paul Ferrara, and music writer Ben Fong Torres. Bruce Botnick, the engineer on **
*this and every subsequent Doors album, guides us through the process of how it **
*was recorded.									**
*										**
*There have been many myths buit up around the Doors, and Jim Morrison in 	**
*particular. In this program which features cuts from "Break On Through (To The **
*Other Side)," "Light My Fire," "End Of The Night," "Alabama Song," "The	**
*Chrystal Ship," "Back Door Man," "Soul Kitchen" and "The End," the music takes **
*center stage, confirming the undeniable fact that the Doors eponymous record   **
*was and remains a true Classic Album.						**
