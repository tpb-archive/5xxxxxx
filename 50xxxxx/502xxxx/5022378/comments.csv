,Bahash99,2009-08-03T11:52Z,"This game is not very fun. I downloaded it and am now in the stage coach scene, not only is it difficult b/c of the bouncing, not b/c of skill, but I am getting shot with noone on the screen. WTF mate."
,0-LSD-0,2009-08-07T05:03Z,"Don't diss the game because you suck at Bahash99.

You're on a stagecoach moving over rocky terrain, did you expect perfectly smooth aiming?
Just get a double barreled shotgun and blow them away as they get close. If you found that part hard, you're gonna have fun later in the game. 'specially at the lift-dynomite part."

,T1mmyD,2009-10-25T22:03Z,"couldn't get the program to install.  i got it down, burned it, and the installer runs, but as soon as the installer gets about 30s into it, all it says is 'logging started' and then gives me the date and time, then quits.  not sure what this means, but i've gotten other DLs from extremezone, so I wouldn't for a second think it's actually a keylogger (at least i hope so).  anyhoo, game wouldn't run for me.  wish it would.  OS = windows 7 ultimate .  components are up to date (i7 cpu, and 275 gtx vid card, all drivers updated), so it isn't the parts.  may be the OS, dunno.  or something.  if anyone has a suggestion, lemme know."
