Valerian: The New Future Trilogy marks a turning point in the long running graphic novel series created by Jean-Claude Mezieres and Pierre Christin. Fans of Luc Besson's "The Fifth Element" will immediately recognize Mezieres images, right from the cover. The flying taxi speeding through the mega-city is one of the defining elements of the movie; and, it was inspired by this book. In fact, Mezieres was one of the conceptual artists for the film, along with Jean "Moebius" Giraud.

Valerian chronicles the adventures of Valerian and Laureline, spatio-temporal agents for the Galaxity. What does that mean? They are secret agents and troubleshooters who work throughout time and space. This volume marks a turning point, as they no longer have Galaxity resources to aid them. This volume consists of three stories: "On the Frontiers", "The Living Weapons," and "The Circles of Power. "On the Frontiers" deals with a rogue spatio-temporal agent who wishes to bring about the destruction of Earth, in order to recreate the Galaxity. "The Living Weapons" tells the tale of a pointless war between two factions, and a troup of actors caught in the middle. "The Circles of Power" relates the story of political corruption and maneuvering. Each story is well told, with doses of humor and irony, and a wonderfully light graphic style. Mezieres fills his worlds with wonderfully bizarre aliens and lush architecture and scenery. His work is somewhat stylized, but very engaging. Christin is a masterful writer who imbues the dialogue with wit and intelligence.

The Valerian series has been highly influential in the world of European graphic novels and science fiction. Its influence has even reached these shores, particularly in the world of Star Wars. There are numerous similarities in the look and population of both series, although Valerian predates Star Wars. From the design of Valerian's ship, to the strange alien creatures, you will find many familiar things.
