In June 2007 guitarist and composer Emiliano Sicilia (author of the solo album - Devotion, Materialize - released in October 2006) started â€œTHE REGARDLESS OF MEâ€ project.
The band presents an experimental kind of Metal - Trip Hop - Progressive music which reminds one of the typical feeling of the Massive Attack, Portishead, Dream Theater, Katatonia and Muse.


All music and lyrics have been composed, arranged and forged by Emiliano Sicilia who is also the main guitarist of the whole project and has taken care of the programming as well. Longtime friends and mates Enrico Cassano (bass guitar) and Fulvio Torresani (drums) complete the line up together with the amazing voice of singer Pamela Manzo.
