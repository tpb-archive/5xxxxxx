Ladies and gentlemen, for your consideration: This torrent contains a complete collection of The Hero Alliance.

The Hero Alliance is a fictional American team of comic book superheroes in an eponymous series published by different companies. It was created by writer Kevin Juaire.

Hero Alliance was first published as a graphic novel by Pied Piper Comics in the late 1980s. It was reprinted in series form with minor edits and additional pages by Innovation Publishing as the series Hero Alliance: End of the Golden Age. The series continued as a one-shot by Wonder Comics, and then moved to its final home at Innovation, where it ran 17 issues, plus numerous special issues.

After the end of Innovation Comics, David Campiti the creator of Hero Alliance, became the American liaison for the Brazilian art studio Glass House Graphics, (also called Deodato Studios). Which had such fan favorite artists as Mike Deodato, Mozart Cuoto and Roger Cruz. In the early 1990s David Campiti published a newsletter claiming that Hero Alliance would be coming out from Extreme Studios and drawn by Glass House Graphics artists. But, it never saw the light of day.

Characters:

[u][b]Victor[/b][/u]: A character similar to Superman he withdrew from the Guardsmen when he became disappointed by the new membership's lack of heroic standards. He regarded the Golden Guardsman as his mentor and rolemodel, and after the current Guardsmen were all killed, his guilt at writing them off led him to try to establish a similar mentoring role over the less experienced and powerful heroes all around him. In his secret identity he was the owner of a chain of fitness centers and a former bodybuilding champion.

[u][b]Kris (Golden Guard)[/b][/u]: Daughter of the original Golden Guardsman, she inherited his superhuman strength and was targeted for murder by her brother, jealous that she had inherited powers and he apparently hadn't. Although she adopted a version of her father's costume early on she took a while to adopt a version of his pseudonym, superheroing for a while just as "Kris".

[u][b]Sepulchre[/b][/u]: Self-confessed murderer of the Guardsmen (by planting bombs in their headquarters), Sepulchre was up until that point regarded as a minor, easily defeated villain. Later it was decided that he was also secretly a knife-wielding serial killer who had never been caught. He was a gadgeteer.

[u][b]Sentry[/b][/u]: A Batman pastiche he kept his powers or lack of same a secret.

[u][b]Apostate[/b][/u]: Growing up apparently without powers, Kris's brother developed a resentment against his father and sister because his father was lavishing attention on his presumable successor as a superhero. He stole his father's helmet, which apparently had electrical powers and used it to kill the old retired superhero, another randomly encountered hero named Predator, and try to kill his sister and Victor. Later it was decided that his electrical powers were innate and the helmet had just been a psychological crutch.

[u][b]Gemini + [/b] [/u]: A pair of twins who passed a superspeed power between each other by touch, it was their capture of Sepulchre and the unimpressed reactions of other heroes to their feat that led to Sepulchre's confession to having killed the Guardsmen.
