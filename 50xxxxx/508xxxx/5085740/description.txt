The "Israeli Wall" video is the official Mr.Pity video for their title track from their debut album of the same name. Produced in association with FugaziQuo productions the video brings a fresh perspective to the situation in Palestine with respect to the wall that is separating both people and hearts with a view to inspire young people both in Israel and Palestine to take up arms in the form of musical instruments, in particular guitars, to emulate the trumpets that brought down the walls of Jericho.

The vision that is hopefully inspired in the video is that both Israelis and Palestinians alike begin to simply ignore the propaganda emanating from either side of the wall and work toward its eventual downfall in the form of music, a gift that people across the world both love and appreciate. It is through music and the creation thereof that hearts and minds from either side of the dividing wall can be freed from the enslaving rhetoric and mutterings that issue from the mainstream media who seek only to perpetuate the goals and ambitions of the few who they serve the few, who for so long, have enjoyed the controlling privilege over nations and peoples that wealth via usury and criminal activity have bestowed upon them at the expense of we the people.

Trumpets brought down the Walls of Jericho, time for guitars to bring down the Israeli Wall.

Mr Pitys album is on sale now. Proceeds from the sale of the album will be donated to various good and worthy causes and people.
