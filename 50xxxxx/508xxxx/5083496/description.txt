	and user objects.

	any reason and slows down daily work? 

	Do you know how this extra load affects your end users? 

	Maybe you are aware of the problem and rely on dangerous scripts or
 	other non-supported third party products? 

	Use Active Directory Janitor to cleanup Active Directory (delete, move or
	disable) accounts and increase your Active Directory security and general
	network performance. The maintenance of Active Directory content needs to
	be done on a regular basis.
