"Joey" is the title of a song recorded by the American country music duo Sugarland. The duo's two members, Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush, wrote it along with country singer Bill Anderson. It was released in July 2009 as the fourth single from the duo's third studio album, Love on the Inside. Sugarland's twelfth single release, it debuted at #50 on the Billboard Hot Country Songs charts in July 2009.

"Joey" was written by Sugarland's two members, Kristian Bush and Jennifer Nettles, along with country singer Bill Anderson. The song is a mid-tempo ballad, backed primarily by acoustic guitar and organ. In it, the narrator blames herself when her love, a teenager named Joey, is killed in a car accident. The lyrics comprise a series of "what if"s, with the narrator asking what would happened if she had taken the keys and driven him home. In the chorus, she speaks to Joey, apologizing and hoping he can hear her message. In the second verse, she asks what would have happened had she never fallen in love with him at all. Nettles said that when she, Bush, and Anderson were writing the song, Anderson compared it to the teenage tragedy songs of the 1950s and 1960s.

On the CD/DVD package Live on the Inside, Sugarland opens this song with a cover version of R.E.M.'s "Nightswimming." A performance of "Nightswimming/Joey" has received rotation on CMT as a music video for the song.
