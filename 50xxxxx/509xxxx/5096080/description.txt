Kyrie Eleison

Kyrie Eleison

Kyrie...

 

The wind blows hard against this mountainside

Across the sea into my soul

It reaches into where I cannot hide

Setting my feet upon the road

 

My heart is old it holds my memories

My bÃŽÂ¿dy burns a gemlike flame

Somewhere between the soul and soft machine

Is where I find myself again

 

Kyrie Eleison

Down the road that I must travel

Kyrie Eleison

Through the darkness of the night

Kyrie Eleison

Where I'm going will you follow

Kyrie Eleison

On a highway in the light

 

When I was young I thought of growing old

Of what my life would mean to me

Would I have followed down my chosen road

Or only wished what I could be 

 

Kyrie Eleison

Down the road that I must travel

Kyrie Eleison

Through the darkness of the night

Kyrie Eleison

Where I'm going will you follow

Kyrie Eleison

On a highway in the light

 

Kyrie Eleison

Down the road that I must travel

Kyrie Eleison

Through the darkness of the night

Kyrie Eleison

Where I'm going will you follow

Kyrie Eleison

On a highway in the light
