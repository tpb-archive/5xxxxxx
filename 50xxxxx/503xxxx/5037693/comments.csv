I mean, what's with that? I've not even entered a serial number or anything of the sort, I tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times, but still doesn't work.

Reading through, I was wondering how do you 'deactivate the software'? I think it's caused by the previous one I tried to install.

Regarding the keygen program... like others, my VP software flagged the .exe file as a trojan horse. I backed up my virtual machine and ran it anyway. It generated license codes that worked fine. However, when I rebooted my VM, WinXP came up and reported that it had failed the MS certified windows test. I restored from the backup VM and everything's OK now.

So, short story is: the keygen and hosts file mod worked (for now), but take precautions before running the keygen."

Thought this might help...

INSTRUCTIONS TO STOP ADOBE FROM CHECKlNG YOUR SERIAL AND DE-ACTIVATING IT

You will be opening a hidden file which needs special permission to open. With a
special terminal command, the file will open automatically in TextEdit. You will
add a few lines of text to the file, save and close. That's it. Pretty simple and
totally not scary, huh? Ok so let's get to it:

Step 1 - If you're still going to install CS4, make sure you install it as a trial
(do not enter a serial number). If you've already installed and have used one of
the expiring serials, load any CS4 app, go to the Help menu and Deactivate.
Quit any open CS4 apps.

Step 2 - Open Terminal (found in Applications/Utilities/). In the terminal window,
paste in:

sudo /Applications/TextEdit.app/Contents/MacOS/TextEdit /etc/hosts

Step 3 - Hit return and type in your admin password.

Step 4 - A file will automatically open in TextEdit. In TextEdit, at the bottom of
the document, hit return and paste in the following:

127.0.0.1 activate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 practivate.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 ereg.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 activate.wip3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 wip3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 3dns-3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 3dns-2.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 adobe-dns.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 adobe-dns-2.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 adobe-dns-3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 ereg.wip3.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 activate-sea.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 wwis-dubc1-vip60.adobe.com
127.0.0.1 activate-sjc0.adobe.com

Step 5 - Save the file. Do NOT do a ""Save As"". Close the file.

Step 6 - If you're on OS X 10.4, reboot. If you're on OS X 10.5, in a new terminal
window, paste in:

sudo dscacheutil -flushcache

Hit return and exit out of Terminal.

Step 7 - Launch any CS4 app and enter the serial from the keygen. The serial will
last for decades.

As from at I can see this method is working with CS4 trials download via
www.adobe.com

Hope this helps :) "

now for the easy part, open up terminal which can be found on application/ utilities/ terminal when the window open check or even copy and paste word for word the information suppplied on the installion file intructions you will noticed theres a few spaces inbetween some words and you have to make sure you input the spaces, otherwise it will not work. when alot of you are stating the terminal doesnt open a new page it does just click cmd and tab its there in the bakground just enter your password and bingo.!

,dlarrym1111,2011-04-06T20:30Z,"I don't have Virtual PC or any way to run any windows anything on my Mac. I'm using 10.4.11 and .exe files do not jive with my OS. Is there a MAC OS 10 native KEY generator for those of us that are not millionaires and cannot afford 8,000 dollar Mac Pros that can run every OS ever made with no problem???? How can I get these instructions to work without the benefit of having WINDOWS at all. It will be a year or more before I'll have the funds to upgrade my Mac and OS. Can ANYONE help?"
,dlarrym1111,2011-04-08T05:48Z,I am stuck at 78% done. Not sure if these stats on seeders and leechers is correct. My software doesn't show ANYONE seeding. PLEASE SEED SEED SEED. I'll seed for a week at full tilt if I can get this to finish downloading! Thanx

I have downloaded the torrent but now need someone to seed the key gen to me please?"
,Dermbet,2011-06-03T14:35Z,the serial posted here seems to work for now
,sams1764,2011-06-19T17:41Z,"@roadready Thank you so much man! I didn't even had to put a serial into photoshop. Say, how can I double check that I have really cracked photoshop? Does it give you a warning saying that the trial ends in this amount of days whenever you start the program? (I followed your instructions and it didn't say anything to me when I ran photoshop after cracking it with the cracked files)."

,LinnyRin,2012-03-26T06:20Z,"I just downloaded it, used the included keygen (had to use Windows because it was a .RAR file), followed the instructions, worked like a charm! I'm going to fiddle around with it now. thanks so much!!"
,3100322,2012-04-01T22:15Z,"I've followed all the instructions and have fully installed and patched the program. The problem I have is when I open it, I get this screen: 

http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/88/screenshot20120401at226.png/

Is there anyway to fix this so it has the normal grey screen I'm used to seeing from other people, or is this then norm?"
,JimmyHat408,2012-04-30T09:54Z,"This solution is for anyone NOT able to open the hosts file via terminal thus not being able to alter the hosts. also this works around anyone have issues with privileges. The simple solution is executing these commands from the 'root user' of OSX. google how to activate your root user because it differs in each installment of OSX. After you have become smart enough to log in as your OSX root user click on the ""go"" tab in the finder bar at the top of the screen. select ""go to file' and enter '/ect' this will take you to a folder with many files inside. open the 'hosts' file inside the folder and make any alterations you need and you should be ready to go. I am assuming you know what to do with this host files, if not then find out. if you do if process and still have issues download 'little snitch' and block the host and adobe files from accessing the internet. I hope this helps someone i rarely find issues i cant solve that have not been already. see ya."
,JimmyHat408,2012-04-30T10:25Z,In addition to the above method an even faster way of finding and editing your hosts file without having to use terminal or root user. just simply click the 'go' tab on the finder bar at the top of your screen. select 'go to folder'. enter ''/etc' as the folder name. find the 'hosts' folder and COPY it to your desktop. make any changes to the replica then after your are satisfied with the changed just drop your modified hosts folder inside the /etc directory when you copied the hosts from. override and ur done.
