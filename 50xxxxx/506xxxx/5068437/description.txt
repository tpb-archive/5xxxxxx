This is Joe Maniscalco's amazing video documentary Aims of the Papacy which exposes the true goals of the Vatican that today hide themselves under various fronts that fool millions. The Romish Church now presents a fair front to the world, covering with apologies her record of horrible cruelties. She has clothed herself in Christ-like garments but she is unchanged. Every principle of popery that existed in ages past exists today. The doctrines devised in the darkest ages are still held. Let none deceive themselves. The popery that Protestants are now so ready to embrace and honor is the same that ruled the world in the days of the Reformation, when men of God stood up at the peril of their lives to expose her iniquity. She possesses the same pride and arrogant assumption that lorded it over kings and princes, and claimed the prerogatives of God. Her spirit is no less cruel and despotic now than when she crushed out human liberty, and slew the saints of the Most High. Popery is just what prophecy declared that she would be - the apostasy of the latter times. It is a part of her policy to assume the character which will best accomplish her purpose; but beneath the variable appearance of the chameleon, she conceals the invariable venom of the serpent. She declares: "We are not bound to keep faith and promises to heretics". Shall this power, whose record for a thousand years is written in the blood of the saints, be now acknowledged as a part of the church of Christ? 50 min. long. A must see for everyone.
