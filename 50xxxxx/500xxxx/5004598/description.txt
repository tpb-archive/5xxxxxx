This gripping tale of urban horror follows the lives of five lonely tenants - strangers - whose lives become intertwined when they discover a dark mark scrawled on the walls of their building. The horror sprouts quite innocently from a small seed and finds life as something otherworldly, damaged, full of love, hate, fear, and power. As the walls come alive, everyone is slowly driven mad - defenseless against the evil in the building, stripped of free will, leaving only confusion, chaos, and eventual death!

By Gabriel Ba, Becky Cloonan, Vasilis Lolos and Fabio Moon.
