Summary

Laurin asks Diaz, in the event of his death, for him to take care of his wife.  Only one of the two men survives the warâ€¦

Review
Abel Ganceâ€™s powerful anti-war film still has the power to move and shock.  Through the intimate microcosm of two soldiers united on the battlefield, Gance shows the horror and absurdity of war for all its worth.  The question he poses is: if two rivals in love can settle their differences in peace, why cannot political leaders?

The film is all the more impressive for Ganceâ€™s uses of location filming on the World War I battlefields of France, during the latter stages of the war.  The filmâ€™s final scene where dead soldiers rise from their graves and see the better world they have created is sublimely moving.
