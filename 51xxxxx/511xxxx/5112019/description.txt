 MTV is on deck with captivating, behind-the-scenes access to Canada's national snowboard team in the new original series OVER THE BOLTS, premiering Sunday, Sept. 20 at 10 p.m. ET/PT on MTV. The show, shot over 12 months, brings viewers unprecedented access to Vancouver 2010 hopefuls. With 28 riders and a maximum of 18 Olympic spots up for grabs, some feel the rush of fulfilling a life-long dream while others experience the agony of being left out in the cold. Encore presentations air Saturdays at 5:30 p.m. ET on CTV beginning Sept. 26.  The show, produced in association with Canada's Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium, uncovers the high-stress world of both athletes and coaches. Watch as they train and compete at World Cup snowboard competitions in Italy, Switzerland, the United States, and Canada for a coveted spot on Canada's Vancouver 2010 snowboard team. Viewers get an intimate look at the battle to maintain balance between competitors' personal lives and careers while coming to grips with Olympic Winter Games pressure.
