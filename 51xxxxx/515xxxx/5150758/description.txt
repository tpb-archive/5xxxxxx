Firstly, thank you all!

My very first torrent and the preview of my next huge upload. I've been a torrentfreak for like two and a half years but never uploaded any according to making this collection. Yes, this is kind of a preview and a rip for those who are interested into psuedo-science, misc. and stuff in other category. I've also made a rar file for those who would want them all. But I'm still electing between these torrents and removing uttercrap to share the only sensible knowledge with you, and hopefully I'll be able to finish cleaning and uploaded in the Q4 of 09. Until that time I wish you all have a great time and a peaceful day. Love with (the) Light. Mikagon.

All my trackers and seedings are working now. My next torrent as I mentioned will be a selection of those torrents and the following directories it will have inside;

O


* 9 ; A folder of my own collection, the things I like, about mytery of Number 9, compilation of other related things to numbers such aas golden ratio, Revelations of Elite Inisders, Water mystery, etc.


* Abook ; Audiobook folder. Containing audio versions of many useful books such as secret, conversations with the god, ramtha and others.

* Anc ; Ancient folder of secrets. Containing ancient secrets, their tehcnologies, languages and knowledges and many more undiscovered mysteries.


* Astro ; The folder which has information on astrology and astronomy contining videos such as in search of dark matter, or universe episodes from discovery channel, BBC and various sources.


* BBC ; BBC documentaries,Sorry but it only has the most interesting ones such as universe and supernatural series since there is an already torrent for all of them, i only got the essential and important ones.


* BMV ; The Folder of Brainwave Mind Voyages. I think I have most of them along with Hem-sync and I-Doser within this folder.


* C2C ; The folder of Coast to Coast, it has not all the coast to coast interviews because I'm not interested in the stuff which is an endless cycle to keep people like us in it o prevent of thinking bout to truth and making us dealing with world problems such as illuminati, conspiracies and many more. It has Interdimensionals, light meditations, secret technologies and other ones that will instead enlighten our wisdom.


* Char ; My favourite folder. The folder of characteristics meaning several kinds of books to improve yourself. A kind of self help one, more like simiiar to enlightened man's book collection but specifically focusing on imrpoving oneself. Sharing experience in an intellectal way.


* Circle of Light ; As you can predict from the folder title, it only has positive sources for it's seekers, many audios and songs for meditation which are relaxing and peaceful. Done with so gente forms or music that is able to touch one's soul. And some other documents to expand you consciousness and world of view.


* CIA ; The folder of CIA. It has many secret footage from CIA and their secret projectsi Experiements on drugs and humans, etc.


* Class ; The folder of "Idontknowyet" ... because I have created it but put nothing Inside. I think I will rmemeber in time why I made it. Probably best guess is for classical music or for videos that gives classes, lessons about learning, still not sure.


* Com ; The Folder to waste time, have fun and learn at the same time, Including many wise comedians such as George Carlin, Bill Hicks and Jeff Dunham. Open to suggestions for more.


* Cons ; Folder of a collection made of conspiracies. It contains only dangerous ones to keep us aware. Because the rest is just an illusion.


* Cosmos ; The folder of osmology, cosmos and the reseachers of cosmos and cosmic stuff. The most rare ones, as usual.


* Dan ; The folder of dancing :D. To get away from this world's problems why not save some time for yourself and relax? Yup it contains the dance shows, lessons and more.


* Dark ; Darkest foldder of this era you may ever see. It has all the dangerous rituals, sacrifices, books, documents, spells, stories, ancient treasures, dark meditations, Invocations and others. Not for the ones who can't dare to touch it.


* Doc ; Since this whole idea is a document itself, this will have the Index or encyclopedia of this huge upcoming torrent. But it also has extras inside, documentary movies such as esoteric agenda, the big picture, kymatica, etc.


* Eastern ; The folder of the East. This folder is a mixed one of the teachings from the east,


* Egypt ; The folder of Egypt containing and revealing their greatest mysteries at the same time while also having rare stuff inside, book of dead and others I can't think of right now.


* Enc ; Folder of dictionaries, encyclopedias. For you can find the most interesting encyclopedias in the world, for psychology, metaphysics, ancient language secrets, world wonders and others.


* Ero ; Folder of erotica. Not for the pornreaks. This folder has or gives knowledge about sex and 'teaches'. So the one who's been telling me that they're watching porn to learn stuff I'm sorry to end the era of your excuse. You need to find a better one now. This folder has many ebooks, famous ones, unfamous but useful ones, videos and mp3s, yup those famous series too, such as Erotic Lounge and rest. Plus It also has useful information for dating tips, hints and secrets.


* ESP ; The folder of my favourite kind of psuedo-science, psychics. It usually has most information on metaphysics, ESP and others which can't be ignored. And I don't give a damn if someone comes me to tell about James Randi or any others. You can't know one's intetion of doing it until you know the real intention behind their words, so stfu. And don't download if you don't want to see this stuff around but if you are interested in telekinesis, psychokinesis and other it contains many useful books and videos, such as Psychic Influence, Huna Magic of Psychic Warrior or Kaltem Gibson's telekinesis V4.4


* Fringe ; The folder of fringe science containing many reseraches like the ones you can see from actualy 'Fringe' seires. Time travel, gene manpulating, and many other crazy ideas which can be titles as next step of science. You know what they say, "If we knew what we were doing, it wouldn't be science." (:


* Hashem ; The folder of Hashem movies, yes all of them, I hope to complete them soon maybe I will also add arrivals or masonic secrets, I don't know.


* Hidden Hand ; The folder I made up myself. Most of the people wants to know who or what was the hidden hand is about. This folder has it's revelations on many websites such as ABT or Godlikeproductions and desteni and some others. ( P.S. Some may wonder why I don't have a Desteni folder. Well they were good in the begining but they "lost it" you know. They have gone beyond their good intetions tho I still appreciate way of teaching showing which is good and bad but don't when they focus on bad more.). And some other trials from our infamous hidden hand.

Phew, even writing all this stuff takes two hours. And yes Such an enormous collection reallt exists, no joke. I can say I have downloaded like %60 of the upcoming stuff and since my new net onnection is much higher I can finish it faster. But please be patient. Being student at the same time and working on projects is hard for me. I have also thought of putting up a Misc., Programs, Pictures, Movie, Music and Game folder but thought size would be too big and since everyone's favourite would be different. If I ever do I will put them on another torrent file and for games I will make the ultimate mugen, put up the ultimate rom image or maybe many enjoyable little games, flash ones, hgames, rpgs, etc. For movie will be the ones only ones that are worth watching to expand your view, Misc. I dont think I need it since I have already put there an uncategorized and unknown folder ready. Well not completel yet but will be. Music would be my favourite artists s?ch as NIN, Tool, MM, Anathema, Tori Amos and maybe some others. But Probably NIN the most since just like tv serie episodes you can find albums on other torrents so what I would have like for Trent would be "nintology" or something containing interviews, music video clips, rarest concerts, albums and limited editions. For programs it would be like a full protection from any kind of hackers, anti-hackers, spywares, viruses, rootkits, adwares, trojans, etc. For theme it would be for like i.e. windows xp black edition or my own. For pictures oh well It's still hard to finish it but I made a collection over 10 thousand pics and I've elected them so far it's a huge one and I like the way it turned out. For pics collection which I'm still collecting, creds goes to many dA users I can't efford to count now. +__+

Thank you all! If you have read an of it up until now. Thanks for sharing your time to read any of this and for your effort.

Have a peaceful day ~
