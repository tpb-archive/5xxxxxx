Microsoft AutoRoute 2010

Microsoft AutoRoute 2010 has been released, or should we say "resurrected", since MSFT has skipped two version years, AutoRoute 2008 and AutoRoute 2009, leaving us believing the excellent trip-planning & GPS navigation software program was discontinued.



The following is not meant to be a full review of the very many features in the product. I will only point out some of the new functionality that were not present in the last version of AutoRoute 2007.

What's new in AutoRoute 2010

Improved map coverage



The new Microsoft AutoRoute 2010 comes with street-level map data of 43 European countries versus the previous version of AutoRoute 2007 which contained detailed map coverage of only 36 countries.

Detail road map data is included for the following European countries: Albania, Andorra, Austria, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Gibraltar, Germany, Greece, Guernsey, Hungary, Italy, Ireland, Jersey, Latvia, Lithuania, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Macedonia, Isle of Man, Monaco, Montenegro, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, San Marino, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and Vatican City.

However, I only see the following countries listed on the drop down menu of the find dialog box: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guernsey, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. So despite the fact that many more countries do have excellent street-level maps, still only the above 17 listed countries have the address find feature implemented.

The limitation of the address find feature would not prevent me from using Microsoft AutoRoute while vacation in any of the other countries. Users can set destination by searching POIs (points of interest), or simply by selecting the destination(s) by clicking on the particular spot(s) on the map.

In total, the new 2010 version contains 8.3 million kilometers or 5.1 million miles of routable roads. Version 2007 had 6.3 million km / 3.9 million miles.
