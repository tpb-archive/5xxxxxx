BBEdit is the leading professional HTML and text editor for the Macintosh

Whatâ€™s new in BBEdit 9?
* Projects â€“ A Project is a vastly improved modern expression of BBEditâ€™s â€œFile Groupâ€ feature. Project windows include an editing view: Click on a file in the Project list, and it immediately appears in the editing window. Projects may contain documents, folders, and Collections â€” custom groupings of documents that can be anywhere on any local or remote computer.

*  Completion â€“ BBEdit will figure out completions for your code or text as youâ€™re editing, either after a delay in typing, or with a keystroke (your choice). Completion can be turned on and off on a per-language basis. They can be derived from a variety of sources, including (but not limited to) Clippings, language-specific completions, and even the system dictionary.

* Edit in Results Windows and Disk Browsers â€“ The text views in browsing windows (disk browsers, search results, syntax-check results, and similar) are now editable; rather than having to open a file into a new window from such a browser, you can just edit it right there in the windowâ€™s lower pane.

* Integration with MobileMe â€“ If you have a MobileMe account, you can keep your BBEdit preferences and your Application Support folder synchronized across machines, preserving your Text Factories, Clippings, and more.

* Modeless Find/Replace Windows â€“ Multi-file search now has a powerful window of its very own, and both the single- and multi-file search windows are modeless, meaning you can work in â€” and copy from â€” open text documents without having to close the search window. The search windowsâ€™ interfaces have been greatly simplified, without sacrificing any functionality.

* Character-level Find Differences â€“ Find Differences now uses the system â€œdiffâ€ tool for generating the difference ranges displayed in the application. The interface has also been improved, allowing you to see more granular differences, not just differences by line. Sub-line differences are visible by twisting the triangle twiddle for each line difference result.
 
* Scratchpad â€“ The Scratchpadâ€™s purpose is to be a space where you can manipulate text by performing quick transforms, manual edits, or batches of copy/paste. It is ideal for quickly beating text from one source into submission before pasting it elsewhere. The Scratchpad window automatically saves its content and state, eliminating those pesky â€œSave Untitled 237?â€ warnings when closing a window or quitting BBEdit.
 
* Save/Copy as Styled Text â€“ Save as Styled Text saves your code as an RTF file, with the same indentations and text coloring as you see in your editor window.
 	
* Search Xcode Projects â€“ An entry in the Find windowâ€™s Source List is now populated by Xcodeâ€™s Recent Projects menu. Selecting one or more Xcode projects will instruct the multi-file search to search each text file in the selected Xcode project(s).
 	
* Fix/ToDo Tracking â€“ Track your coding tasks easily: Ruby, C, Obj-C, C++, and header files will now show commented FIXME and TODO items in the function popup.

* Improved Autosave â€“ The application automatically saves its state (open documents and windows) once per minute, so if something bad happens to your machine, thereâ€™s a pretty good chance that the next time you start up, things will be as they were when the event occurred.
 
* Tab-key functionality â€“ The tab key can now be set to perform certain actions (in addition to its existing important-but-mundane function of indentation), including â€œgo to next placholder,â€ and â€œindent text blocks.â€
 
* Preview in MS Windows browsers â€“ We now recognize application stubs created by VMWare Fusion 2.0â€™s â€œUnityâ€ feature, so that you can preview your HTML documents in Windows versions of Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Internet Explorer in Fusion.
