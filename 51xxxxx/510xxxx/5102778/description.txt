            Python is a programming language that lets you work 
            more quickly  and integrate your systems more effectively. 
            You can learn to use Python and see almost immediate gains in
            productivity and  lower maintenance costs.

            Python runs on Windows, Linux/Unix, Mac OS X, and has
            been ported to the Java and .NET virtual machines.
            Python is free to use, even for commercial products,
            because of its OSI- approved open source license.
