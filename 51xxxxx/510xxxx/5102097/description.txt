Following are the known issues for Workstation 6.5.3:

    * On 64-bit hosts, linked clones created from third-party backup images (for example, Symantec Backup Exec System Recovery files, Acronis True Image files, or StorageCraft ShadowProtect files) fail at startup with the error message: Cannot write to third-party image.
    * While attempting to drag and drop a file to or from an Ubuntu 9.0.4 guest while in Unity mode some unusual behaviors have been reported, including failures to move files, screen refresh issues, and the inability to exit from Unity mode.
    * Drag and drop or copy and paste operations from a Windows XP guest to a 64-bit Ubuntu 9.04 host might produce the following error message: Error while copying.
    * When performing a drag and drop operation from the latest version of a Windows guest to a Ubuntu 9.0.4 host in Unity mode, an error message appears: The source and destination file names are the same. After cancelling the error message, you can drop the file successfully.
    * You will receive an error message after cancelling a drag and drop operation from the latest Windows guest to an Ubuntu 9.04 Desktop host.
    * If a guest is powered off while a drag and drop operation from a guest to a Linux host is in progress, drag and drop will not work after the guest is restarted. To workaround this issue, restart the host.
    * Easy Install does not work for 32-bit and 64-bit FreeBSD 7.1 guests.
    * Enabling Assistive Technology on a 64-bit SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 10.1 host prevents the Workstation from starting.
    * When converting Windows 2000 or Windows Server 2003, the Server License Information selected in the Conversion Wizard is not used, as a result, the default licensing mode is used in the guest.
    * On an Ubuntu 9.04 host, launching a Java application in a virtual machine that uses the Workstation Eclipse debugger plug-in, might cause Eclipse to crash.
    * VMX hangs in an ATI fglrx driver on an Ubuntu 9.04 host.
