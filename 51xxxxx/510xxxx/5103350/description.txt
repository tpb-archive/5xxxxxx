 The ear is the super highway to the brain, a channel through which iMusic sends beats and pulses through your ear drums into your brain, creating subtle vibrations that echo into the sensory cortex, causing a precise cortical evoked response that entrains the brain into a change of frequency, eliciting an immediate and powerful change in mental state. No matter your age, intelligence, cultural background or system of beliefs, this physiological phenomenon is a hardwired and natural behavior that we all share. Whether we're learning, thinking, relaxing, working, training or playing, the experience can become richer, more powerful, higher in intensity and produce better quality results.
