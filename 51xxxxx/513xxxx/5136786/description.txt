As the "European Flu" virus spreads throughout the world, governments realise the scale of the problem. After a few days of the virus spreading, people fall ill, including Abby Grant, Jenny Collins and her friend Patricia.

When Al Sadiq, Greg Preston, Najid and Tom Price wake up, they find everyone around them is dead and struggle to find any other survivors. Abby wakes up from her illness, to find that her husband did not survive and searches the country for her missing son. Eventually, the characters meet and realise they are going to have to stick together to survive.
