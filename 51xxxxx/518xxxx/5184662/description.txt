Dawn is here and with a new day comes new torrents! :)

With todays release i also introduce a new tag, my [complete+] tag. In the future i will use this tag to indicate releases which include bonus content like oneshots artbooks etc. which brings me to todays release my ultimate death note pack, the full series + the pilot, a oneshot, extra and an artbook! i hope you will enjoy it. :)

As always error reports and manga requests are welcome, just post a comment.

And the usual disclaimer. nothing i upload is scanlated by me so i cant do anything about image/translation quality etc. credits pages and possibly some fan art are included if they where included where i downloaded the files from, i don't add or remove anything from group releases.

summery (from baka-updates manga who in turn attribute it to Viz)

Light Yagami is an ace student with great prospects--and he's bored out of his mind. But all that changes when he finds the Death Note, a notebook dropped by a rogue Shinigami death god. Any human whose name is written in the notebook dies, and now Light has vowed to use the power of the Death Note to rid the world of evil. But when criminals begin dropping dead, the authorities send the legendary detective L to track down the killer. With L hot on his heels, will Light lose sight of his noble goalâ€¦or his life?
