The Harder They Come (1972)
A rare classic, must see!
Starring Raggae singer Jimmy Cliff as Ivanhoe Martin, a character based on Rhyging, a real-life Jamacian criminal who achieved fame in the 1940s.

Ivanhoe Martin is a poor Jamaican man in search of a job, before finally getting one as a reggae singer. Upon the verge of a hit record, he discovers the only way he can get a hit record is by signing away the rights. Eventually, Jose (played by Carl Bradshaw), one of the first people he met after he moved to Kingston, offers him an opportunity dealing marijuana. He turns to a life of crime and violence. There are two versions of the filmâ€”one with subtitles and one withoutâ€”and each has a different ending.
In the version of the film without subtitles, the last ten minutes consist of Ivan swimming towards a speeding ship which would take him to safety. However, he can not grab onto the ladder dangled off the side, and he opens his eyes to find himself beached ashore. He sleeps in the shade of a tree then wakes, alerted to the presence of policemen with rifles. He comes out and lowers his revolvers, but the police shoot him many times and the film ends abruptly, cutting to the credits. He is presumed dead.
