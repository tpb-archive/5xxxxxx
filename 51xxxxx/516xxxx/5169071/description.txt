DAYS OF DANIEL'S 70TH WEEK The Last Seven Years before Jesus Christ Returns
 
http://www.babylonthegreatisfalling.net
Peace covenant between Israel and enemies arranged by America, Daniel 9:27, Revelation 6:2, 8:1. Construction of temple begins. Days of religious, political deception will be shortened when Russia invades within 1,230 days, Matthew 24:22. Rapture is history, body of Christ in Heaven, Revelation 4. Jesus comes in 2,520 days.

220th Day

Temple construction allows for sacrifices and oblations to begin. Taken away in 1,010 days by Russian-Syrian leader. Jesus comes in 2,300 days. Temple site then cleansed, Daniel 8:13-14.

869th Day

Two witnesses begin 1,260 day ministry, Revelation 11:3. They will be warning the Jews of the imminent Russian-Syrian invasion. Their ministry will be during both halves of the 70th Week because of Revelation 11:6, which shows God's judgment of water
to blood, which occurs in last half; and Revelation 11:10, which shows world rejoicing at the death of two witnesses. If they ministered only in the last half, the world would be terrified and mourning at sight of returning Lord, not rejoicing. If they minister only first half, how can waters turn to blood, which is God's wrath? Witnesses preach against beast and harlot church and for the coming of Jesus in power and glory. Jesus comes in 1,651 days.

Days of religious, political deception (world peace) will be shortened or elect would be deceived. Days shortened by Russian confederacy invading the Middle East sometime between the 869th and 1,230th day, Ezekiel 38, Daniel 11. World War III erupts, probably nuclear and conventional. Takes peace from earth, Revelation 6:4.

1,230th Day

Russian-Syrian leader takes away sacrifices of Jews, Daniel 8:11, 11:31, 12:11. Within 30 days the first of seven trumpet judgments begin as God destroys Russian-Syrian armies, Ezekiel 38:22, Revelation 8:7. Days of war and sudden destruction shortened or all flesh perish, (nuclear war) Matthew 24:22. Jesus comes in 1,290 days, Daniel 12:11)

1,260th Day

Midweek. Antichrist from America has been resurrected from the dead. Armies of America and Western Europe have invaded and now occupy Israel and the Middle East. Antichrist causes sacrifices to cease. Makes temple desolate by saying he is God, Daniel 9:27, 12:11. Antichrist or beast given power over all nations, and persecutes the saints, Revelation 13:7. Jesus comes in 1,260 days.

Wrath of God meets wrath of Satan for 1,260 days. Days of Great Tribulation and days of Jacob's Trouble. Great days of real revival through two witnesses and 144,000 Jewish evangelists, Revelation 7.

6th trumpet sounds for 3 1/2 days. Two witnesses complete 1,260-day ministry. Killed by antichrist from America. Bodies left in streets of Jerusalem for 3 1/2 days, Revelation 11:8, 11. Antichrist will order their bodies to be untouched as a mockery to the prophecy of their resurrection. Their death and display of bodies angers God. Judgments will intensify. Last hour, day, month, year (391 days) of bowl judgments result of God's anger. Fullness of God's wrath, Revelation 9:15, 10:7, 15:7. Jesus comes in 391 days.

2,520th Day

Fire from Heaven has destroyed America or Babylon the Great, Revelation 18. Jesus Christ appears in the skies for all eyes to see Him. Antichrist and false prophet are cast in to Lake of Fire, Revelation 19:20. Jesus first destroys all world's armies at Armageddon, who have been gathered by beast and false prophet to fight against Him, thinking He is an alien invading force, Revelation 1:7, 19:11-21. Satan is cast into the bottomless pit for 1,000 years, Revelation 20:1-3. All saints who were in Heaven come with Jesus. Judgment of surviving people of the nations begins. Temple cleansed of antichrist. 2,300 days completed, Daniel 8:13-14. 1,000-year reign of Jesus Christ begins. Praise God!
