Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oh! 
Caught in a bad romance 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oh! 
Caught in a bad romance 

Rah-rah-ah-ah-ah-ah! 
Roma-roma-mamaa! 
Ga-ga-ooh-la-la! 
Want your bad romance 

Rah-rah-ah-ah-ah-ah! 
Roma-roma-mamaa! 
Ga-ga-ooh-la-la! 
Want your bad romance 

I want your ugly 
I want your disease 
I want your everything 
As long as it?s free 
I want your love 
(Love-love-love I want your love) 

I want your drama 
The touch of your hand 
I want your leather-studded kiss in the sand 
I want your love 
Love-love-love 
I want your love 
(Love-love-love I want your love) 

You know that I want you 
And you know that I need you 
I want it bad, your bad romance 

I want your love and 
I want your revenge 
You and me could write a bad romance 
(Oh-oh-oh--oh-oooh!) 
I want your love and 
All your lovers' revenge 
You and me could write a bad romance 

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oh! 
Caught in a bad romance 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oh! 
Caught in a bad romance 

Rah-rah-ah-ah-ah-ah! 
Roma-roma-mamaa! 
Ga-ga-ooh-la-la! 
Want your bad romance 

I want your horror 
I want your design 
?Cause you?re a criminal 
As long as your mine 
I want your love 
(Love-love-love I want your love-uuhh) 

I want your psycho 
Your vertigo stick 
Want you in my rear window 
Baby you're sick 
I want your love 
Love-love-love 
I want your love 
(Love-love-love I want your love) 

You know that I want you 
('Cause I'm a freak bitch baby!) 
And you know that I need you 
I want a bad, bad romance 

I want your love and 
I want your revenge 
You and me could write a bad romance 
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh!) 
I want your love and 
All your lovers' revenge 
You and me could write a bad romance 

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oh! 
Caught in a bad romance 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oh! 
Caught in a bad romance 

Rah-rah-ah-ah-ah-ah! 
Roma-roma-mamaa! 
Ga-ga-ooh-la-la! 
Want your bad romance 

Rah-rah-ah-ah-ah-ah! 
Roma-roma-mamaa! 
Ga-ga-ooh-la-la! 
Want your bad romance 

Walk, walk fashion baby 
Work it 
Move that bitch crazy 

Walk, walk fashion baby 
Work it 
Move that bitch crazy 

Walk, walk fashion baby 
Work it 
Move that bitch crazy 

Walk, walk fashion baby 
Work it 
I'm a freak bitch, baby 

I want your love and 
I want your revenge 
I want your love 
I don?t wanna be friends 

Je veux ton amour 
Et je veux ta revanche 
Je veux ton amour 
I don?t wanna be friends 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh! 
I don?t wanna be friends 
(Caught in a bad romance) 
I don?t wanna be friends 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh! 
Want your bad romance 
(Caught in a bad romance) 
Want your bad romance! 

I want your love and 
I want your revenge 
You and me could write a bad romance 
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh! 
I want your love and 
All your lovers' revenge 
You and me could write a bad romance 

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oh! 
Want your bad romance 
(Caught in a bad romance) 
Want your bad romance 

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oooh-oh-oh-oh-oh! 
Want your bad romance 
(Caught in a bad romance) 

Rah-rah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

Ga-ga-ooh-la-la! 
Want your bad romance
