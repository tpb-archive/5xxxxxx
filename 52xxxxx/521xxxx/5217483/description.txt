    PureBasic is a native 32 bit and 64 bit programming language based on 
    established BASIC rules. The key features of PureBasic are portability 
(Windows, Linux, MacOS X and AmigaOS are currently supported), the production 
of very fast and highly optimized executables and, of course, the very simple 
BASIC syntax. PureBasic has been created for the beginner and expert alike. We 
have put a lot of effort into its realization to produce a fast, reliable and 
                          system friendly language.  
     
 In spite of its beginner-friendly syntax, the possibilities are endless with 
   PureBasic's advanced features such as pointers, structures, procedures, 
   dynamically linked lists and much more. Experienced coders will have no 
 problem gaining access to any of the legal OS structures or API objects and 
                      PureBasic even allows inline ASM.
