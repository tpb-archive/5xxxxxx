             SnapShot is disk imaging software that enables the               
             user to back up, restore and view backed up hard                 
             disk data, easily and safely. Using WindowsNT driver             
             technology, Snapshot brings two new features to disk             
             imaging:                                                         
                                                                              
             1. Snapshot Backup - create disk images while                    
             Windows is running. This allows the user to work in              
             his usual environment when backing up his data. Any              
             device suitable for file storage can be used for the             
             image destination, like your local drive, a network              
             drive or any removable drive. And - most important -             
             the image will be an industrial quality image, even              
             though WinNT constantly writes to the disk. The user             
             may continue to work normally, while a backup                    
             operation is in progress; the image will still be                
             valid and consistent. This enables one of the most               
             important things in backup business: backup often.               
             It is even possible to make an image backup for                  
             servers, that must be online 24 hours a day.                     
                                                                              
             Snapshot Backup - Main use. Snapshot Backup is aimed             
             at the backup/disaster recovery market. There is                 
             little use for on the fly disk image creation, if                
             you want to deploy hundreds or thousands of                      
             workstations. We think however, that the possibility             
             to do on the fly backup is very important for the                
             end user to regularly protect his data. At least,                
             this was our reason to create Snapshot. No need to               
             shut down and boot from floppy, no need to create                
             network disks, and no need to wait half an hour for              
             the backup process - we think that's nice.                       
                                                                              
             2. Snapshot View - Explore saved disk images the                 
             friendly way. The image file is presented to the                 
             user as a virtual drive. This virtual drive can be               
             used like any other drive, using any Windows                     
             program, be it Explorer, Norton Commander, or your               
             favourite MP3 Player.                                            
                                                                              
             Snapshot View - Main use. Snapshot View is a very                
             easy and powerful method to explore disk images.                 
             This technique could be easily adapted to disk                   
             images created by other disk imaging programs.                   
                                                                              
                                                                              
             FEATURES:                                                        
                                                                              
             * Create Disk Image Backups, While Running Windows.              
               The Backup process will back up all your data into             
               a single file, containing all data, including                  
               system data and registry, for total security,                  
               should your computer ever crash. There is no                   
               restart (to DOS) necessary. Ever.                              
                                                                              
             * Continue your work, while the Backup is in                     
               progress. The new Snapshot technology ensures that             
               all data are consistent, and reflect the PC's data             
               at the start of backup. There are no difficulties              
               with opened files. Ever. This enables a very fast              
               and easy way to back up servers and other                      
               computers, that must run 24 hours a day.                       
                                                                              
             * Easy Use and Restore of single Files or                        
               directories. Drive Snapshot creates a virtual                  
               drive, containing all your drive's data. You may               
               use, compare, or restore these files directly from             
               the Disk Image file. This works with any program               
               of your choice, including (of course) the Windows              
               Explorer.                                                      
                                                                              
             * Complete Restore of a disk in case of Disaster. If             
               a disk is restored to its original state, it will              
               be exactly the same as at the time of Backup -                 
               byte for byte. Restoring a system partition will               
               require DOS; other drives can be restored using                
               Windows.                                                       
                                                                              
             * Compatible with all Windows file systems (FAT16,               
               FAT32, NTFS). Supports Linux EXT2/3/Reiser.                    
                                                                              
             * Compatible with all Windows RAID Methods.                      
                                                                              
             * Very easy and comprehensive command line
