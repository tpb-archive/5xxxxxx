Notes:
I made this rip after I was looking around for high quality rips I could use on my
network storage unit instead of storing the complete dvd's. And I noticed there where
some complains about the complete seasons/sets I could find. Mostly that it was poor
quality, probably because it used the rather poor PAL transfer as it's sources.
So I ripped my own discs from the NTSC Limited Edition complete box set instead.
