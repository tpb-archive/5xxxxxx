Master Voyager was especially designed to create password protected DVD/CD discs and USB Flash Drives (Pendrive). Protected Disc/Pendrive is fully autonomous and does not need any special software installed on computer. It is possible to create protected media on first computer and "play" it on a second computer with installed OS: Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP. 

 

Master Voyager would be helpful in the following situations:

â€¢Password protected CD/DVD with large ammount of sensitive data inside can be safely sent via usual postal mail

â€¢Encrypted backups on CD/DVD can be kept in public places

â€¢Encrypted USB Flash Drive can be stolen, but confidential documents will remain confidential.

â€¢No need to decrypt files on DVD/Pendrive before the use. Just enter password and work with any document on DVD/USB Flash Drive as with any usual storage device.
Main Features:

â€¢Transparent decryption.  There is no need to decrypt data from DVD/CD/USB or copy files from CD/USB to hard disk. Just enter password and work. Open encrypted documents directly from CD/USB and even launch programs or play movies. Master Voyager utilizes special on-the-fly decryption technology invented for CryptoExpert Professional software. 
â€¢Do not worry about data confidentiality. Master Voyager uses 100% strong encryption of protected contents: AES 256-bit. AES is Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) and used to protect sensitive information by U.S.Government organizations and commercial organizations (banks and others).

It is fully autonomous.
