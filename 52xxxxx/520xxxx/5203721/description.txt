  Release Description:
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    PREPARE INVOICES AND SALES RECEIPTS IN JUST SECONDS
   Once you've spent just a few minutes with the program, you can prepare
   and print invoices and sales receipts in literally seconds! Designed
   with ease of use as a primary feature, the friendly menu system
    will also help you maintain Product and Customer Lists,
   quickly search for past documents, print useful reports, send invoices
   to customers (print, fax, or e-mail), and much more. 
   
    TRACK IMPORTANT INFORMATION RELATED TO EACH SALE
   A powerful, easy-to-use search wizard makes locating previous entries
   fast and easy. A built in Sales Journal will help you track how many
   sales were made during a certain period, monitor salesperson
   performance, and determine the total amount of sales tax collected for a
   given period. The program will also keep customer and product lists so
   you can reuse data and minimize typing. Please see our screen shots
   for visual examples of these features.
