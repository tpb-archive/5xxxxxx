,emp_athy,2010-04-28T05:47Z,"Hello there =)

Thank you for the upload.

However, it's not working for me. I wonder if you can help me please? 

I've downloaded it, but for some reason, two files have been saved as VLC format. 

Both are 
cyg-mx4c.cue

Alongside I have the serial, and a ISO File cyg-mx4a.iso

Can you direct me in any way as to what's gone wrong? 

Do I need to change the application for the files saved as vlc? 

Quite perplexed to be honest. Any help, much appreciated. 

Thanks :)"
,MaxMouseG,2010-05-15T13:31Z,"Works freaken great. Looks like 100% working and Got Materials installed without using a disk at all..

To people who are having trouble installing the Materials the Material are already with the download but you have to do this:

After you've opened the .ISO, copy the ""Material"" folder and ""material.inf"" file from it to somewhere (e.g. create ""Manga Studio EX4"" folder) on your PC, then browse to
""Material\Settings\3D Data\09_3D Data CollectionVol1_School\Principalufs Room and Meeting Rooms"", replace ""u umlaut"" with ""u"" in the end of path, start Manga Studio EX4 and when it asks to copy them materials choose ""From folder..."" and point to ""Manga Studio EX4"" folder. That should do the trick.


(To people who don't understand what a umlaut is on the name Principalufs Room and Meeting Rooms. Its a letter u that has two dot above it.. thats the letter you are supposed to replace)

and emp_athy  just extract the ISO and click Autoplay

"
,chelseadagger,2010-05-15T14:13Z,could someone direct me towards the serial number? i definitely do not see it.
,MaxMouseG,2010-05-16T09:14Z,When you extracted it should be right in there with the file name called serial...
,Sigeram,2010-06-19T10:00Z,"When I click the install button in the Start Page it just gives me a blank notice.

,Mimi267,2010-06-27T09:09Z,"I got as far as downloading the program, but when I began installing the materials from the disc, it stopped mid way saying ""the system cannot find the file specified""

,neurobot,2010-08-15T22:17Z,"Works great thanks - 
Another easy way to install - burn ISO to disc with free ImgBurn software - then install from disc by hitting ""äutorun""."
,RBP888,2010-08-16T16:30Z,"Works great! I used VCDControlTool to mount it & Checked it's virus free. Thanks a bunch!
Btw, you dont need to specify the file location to download additional 'materials'. just click proceed without installations and then a window will appear asking for the serial key. Just key in the serial key & you can use manga studio right away! =]"
,amaurilondon,2010-08-24T14:09Z,"Thanks very much for the upload THEAKER!...I could get the program and the extra material working after a short while.
You rock man!"

,Dore-san,2010-11-11T15:04Z,"I have daemon tools
I put the iso-resistant in daemon tools,but it won't mount. only it can do with that iso is: to add,
to remove and to burn with astroburn. 
Help please?"
,CherokeePlaza,2010-12-03T17:03Z,"OMG!! After reading about so many people encountering problems installing this, I was REALLY worried.  Guys, it was a piece of cake and I'm a complete novice when it comes to using image files.  I absolutely hate them and I've only used them 2 times out of desperation when I couldn't find the programs I needed in any other format.  

This was, without a doubt, one of the easiest installations I've ever had.  First, I downloaded the Daemon Tools Pro and installed it.  Then I simply mounted the image and installed.  As soon as it finished initial install, it will ask you if you want to install the materials.  Just click yes and it will finish the install very quickly and without a single problem.  I was never even asked for the 'original' disk or anything else.  To make it really easy on yourself, just go ahead and install Daemon Tools Pro first and use it to install this.  You shouldn't have any problems then.

BTW, I'm using Windows XP - and like I said, I've only used image files 2 times {including this time} EVER.  I HATE them because I don't understand them completely.  This was really, really easy though. Good luck and thanks, Theaker for the great upload.  My son loves drawing Manga, so I'm hoping he'll really like this.  "

,atsuchan,2010-12-15T04:02Z,"well it downloaded just fine, but i get the same Notice: Windows XP thing when I try to install. Nuts. I guess this doesn't work with Windows XP Professional, what a bummer. Guess I'll just have to torrent it on the ol' Windows Vista machine and see how it goes. "
,ItsJazmin,2010-12-19T15:52Z,"Worked perfectly~

It's now finished and works fine!"
,Tigerpanda13,2011-02-28T12:33Z,"Hi!
First off all, thanks for the upload!
But I have a problem. I downloaded, and opened with daemon, installed the main program.
But the files cyg-mx4b and cyg-mx4c turned into vlc's... So I cant install the bonus disk. Someone who can help? ^^"
,kaiyodei,2011-03-03T02:21Z,"so I need to burn to a disk then install? I installed but then it says I need the disk with the extras, the extras are  in the whole zipp'ed file.
how do I ad them? I need that other program.
should I uninstall and reinstall mangastudio 4? 

do I just move all the extra filters?

perhaps If I like enough I'll then go and buy, and like enough for dedication making a comic. I went for it in a fit of rage aginst painter 10 and it's crashyness.

that's what I'll do.

so what do I do?"

no clue why some of you guys are having trouble with it.
it installed fine, then when i opened it, it prompted me to install the materials, so i clicked 'install from disc' and it installed them from the still mounted image
copied/pasted the serial without error as well.

using vista and poweriso (which in my experiences is FAR more reliable then daemon tools)




only thing i have to wonder is, why are there cue files for a disc 2 and 3 in the zip?  completely useless since the program is a single iso."
,ReNua,2011-07-31T10:40Z,"When I try to install the materials, it stops halfway through, and gives me an error that says ""The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect"".

Help?"

Mucho thanks to Theaker. Arigato goshaimash.

THE EASIEST AND HASSLE-FREE WAY TO INSTALL (FOR DUMMIES):

1. Download and install WinCDEmu (Open-Source alternative to Power ISO, and better). Try googling.

2. Extract the contents from Theaker's Rar file (7Zip is an open source alternative to WinRar, if you haven't got any one of these).

3. Right click on the ISO file in the extracted folder, and open with WinCDEmu.

4. WinCDEmu opens the ISO file like a virtual DVD drive, and you see the Install menu, with the green warrior in the foreground.

5. When the installer prompts your Windows version, click OK.

6. After install, keep the virtual drive running- don't close it.

7. Run Manga Studio. At the prompt choose install from disk. The software automatically gets the additional materials by itself. Done!

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS:
1. This one has no virus/trojan/Achilles/etc. If your antivirus prompts for one, it means two things:
a) Your AV software is stupid.
b) You're stupid to believe in a stupid antivirus.

MUCH THANKS AGAIN TO THEAKER.
MARVELOUS UPLOAD!
:)
