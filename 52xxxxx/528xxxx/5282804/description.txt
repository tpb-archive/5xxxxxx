Tai, a young man arrested on a crime charge, is discharged thanks to
his twin brother Tan's dogged help. After being set free, he finds
Tan in a coma with severe injuries. Tan's girlfriend, Pang, tells Tai
that his brother got involved in some risky business to raise money
to fight Tai's case. Tai feels guilty that his problems brought his
brother trouble. He then traces what happened to Tan, which
ultimately leads him into illegal basketball gambling. Tai wants to
find out who is behind this gambling and why his brother was beaten
unconscious. He finally joins the "Fireball" team, a team which
belongs to Hia Den and whose players include Singha, Kay, Ik, and
Muek. In order to uncover the truth, Tai trades many things-possibly
even his life.
