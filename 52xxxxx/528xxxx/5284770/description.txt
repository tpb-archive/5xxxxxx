PLOT SUMMARY FOR "SONS OF ANARCHY"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sons of Anarchy, aka SAMCRO, is a motorcycle gang that operates both illegal and legal businesses in the small town of Charming. They combine gun-running and a garage, plus involvement in porn film. Clay, the president, likes it old school and violent; while Jax, his stepson and the club's VP, has thoughts about changing the way things are, based on his dead father's journal. Their conflict has effects on both the club and their personal relationships.
===============================================================================
SEASON ONE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Sons of Anarchy is an outlaw motorcycle club with many chapters in the United States. The Charming local is the original founding chapter of the Sons of Anarchy.

The Charming chapter is based out of a clubhouse adjacent to the Teller-Morrow auto mechanic shop. Led by Clay Morrow, the club protects and controls Charming through close community relationships, bribery and violent intimidation. The full name of the motorcycle club is Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original Charter; on occasion, the show will abbreviate it as SOA, though more frequently the club is referred to as SAMCRO (an acronym of Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, Redwood Original ) or Sam Crow. This nickname is also reflected in the original title of the show, Forever Sam Crow.

The club's leathers also refer to "Men of Mayhem," Jax has worn a hat that says "Reaper Crew," and their logo is a grim reaper wielding an M-16 with a bloody scythe blade and holding a crystal ball with the anarchy "A". Another symbol of the club is the crow. (At least two female characters affiliated with the club have crow tattoos.) As for the motorcycles, the Sons mostly ride customized Harley-Davidson Dynas.

Club members have "day jobs" in local industries, most of them working at Clay's auto repair shop, but they primarily make money by illegally importing weapons and selling them to drug gangs in the East Bay, along with protection runs for local businesses by protecting valuable truck shipments from hijacking.

SAMCRO keeps meth traffickers out of Charming, which puts them at odds with the meth-distributing white supremacist "Nords" gang, the Nordics, headed by Ernest Darby. Unlike their rivals, the Sons are relatively diverse and inclusionist, openly rejecting the Nords' white supremacy. The SOA also have to deal with a rival Oakland-based MC, the "Mayans" led by Marcus Alvarez, who control the neighboring territory of northern Nevada. Other groups in SAMCRO's orbit include the San Francisco-based Chinese American mafia Lin Triad, led by Henry Lin, the Italian American Cacuzza crime family, the True IRA of Ireland, which supplies them with illegal Russian-made guns, the One-Niners, an African American street gang (who also appeared on The Shield, thus possibly putting the two in the same fictional universe) to whom SAMCRO sell weapons, and various affiliates in the state prison system, where many members of the club have been incarcerated at one time or another.

The club operates out of a clubhouse attached to the Teller-Morrow auto shop. The clubhouse includes a living area (where Jax, at one point, camped out after leaving his house to ex-wife Wendy following their divorce), a bar, a pool table and an elaborate conference table made of redwood that has a reaper logo carved into the top. The club also owns a secluded cabin in the woods and formerly had a warehouse outside of town where they assembled the illegal weapons. They start the series looking for a new warehouse space, and end the first season with most of their finances tied up in building a new one.

John Teller and Piermont "Piney" Winston co-founded SAMCRO in 1967 following their return from service as paratroopers during the Vietnam War. Six of the "Redwood Original 9" members were vets; Clay Morrow was the youngest of the original members. Following John's death in 1993, his widow Gemma married Clay.

John and Gemma's surviving son Jax (another son, Tommy, died in childhood of the "family flaw", a congenital heart defect) is second in the club's line of succession after co-founder and sitting president Clay. Jax is recently divorced from Wendy, the mother of his son Abel, who is born 10 weeks premature as a result of his mother's crank (crystal meth) addiction. Jax is also connected to Tara, a doctor at St. Thomas Hospital. The two were high school sweethearts.

SEASON TWO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Production of the new season began on April 23, 2009; Season two premiered on Tuesday, September 8 at 10 p.m. WST. According to Kurt Sutter, "This season is all about internal alliances. For me, the big antagonist this season is just a catalyst to ignite the deep, primal conflicts within the club. Lives will be threatened, sides will be taken and SAMCRO will become the biggest threat to the SAMCRO."

The season opens with a new threat in the form of white separatists (in the premiere episode they say they are not supremacists) called the League Of American Nationalists (L.O.A.N. for short) descending upon the town of Charming. Led by businessman Ethan Zobelle and backed by Zobelle's enforcer, A.J. Weston, the two seek to drive the Sons of Anarchy from the town of Charming, on behalf of a group of wealthy would-be developers (one of them being Deputy Chief Hale's brother) looking to expand the town beyond the sort of "Small Town USA" status kept by SAMCRO, to an investment opportunity of strip malls and condos. The duo make their intentions known when they walk into the garage and tell Clay that he is done "selling guns to color." Zobelle then arranges for the kidnapping and gang-rape of Gemma Teller by Weston and two other men, as a warning to the group. We see later that it was Zobelle's own daughter who sets Gemma up when she pulls behind Gemma's car in her mini-van and pretends to be a mother in distress. However, Gemmaâ€™s rape does not have the effect that Zobelle and Weston were hoping for, as Gemma does not reveal to Clay what happened. Instead, the only ones who know the truth are Chief Unser (who found Gemma after she was raped), Tara (who treated her injuries), and later, Deputy Chief Hale. Because of this, L.O.A.N. resorts to other methods to rid Charming of SAMCRO. Very few of L.O.A.N.â€™s attempts involve a direct assault on the club. Instead, Zobelle and crew seem to look for ways to provoke SAMCRO into destroying themselves.

The animosity between Gemma and Tara has cooled and even turned into a bit of respect for each other. This is largely due to Taraâ€™s help with Abel and with Gemma after her rape. Elsewhere, Tara and Jax move towards rekindling their relationship even as Gemma tacitly gives Tara her blessing by telling the doctor to demand complete honesty from Jax in order to ensure that their relationship can survive Jax's dual loyalty towards Tara and the club. Unfortunately, while Jax and Tara grow closer, Gemma and Clayâ€™s relationship struggles and Gemma struggles with the after affects of her rape which is complicated by the fact that Clay knows nothing about it.

From prison, Otto Delaney reaches out to SAMCRO, asking them to help his wife, Luann, and her porn studio after a raid from law enforcement and intimidation from a rival pornographer, Georgie Caruso, threaten her business. Jax proposes that SAMCRO become partners in Luannâ€™s studio and offer protection to her and her performers, a move he hopes will raise money for the club legitimately while they re-build their other revenue streams.

Opie, struggling to deal with Donnaâ€™s death, throws himself fully into the MC and, consequently, becomes increasingly distant from his children. Opieâ€™s relationship with Jax also becomes strained as Opie, who is unaware of Clayâ€™s role in Donnaâ€™s death, becomes increasingly loyal to Clay and distant from Jax. Later on, Opie becomes involved with Lyla, one of Luannâ€™s performers, who is, herself, a single mother. This development is not met well by some involved with SAMCRO, particularly Tara, who do not think that Opieâ€™s children need to be around a porn star.

Fueled by SAMCROâ€™s role in Donnaâ€™s death, the rift between Clay and Jax continues to grow, with Jax challenging most of the decisions that Clay makes. This has repercussions throughout the whole club. Tig, Happy, and Opie remain steadfastly loyal to Clay, while Piney, Chibs, and Bobby begin to side more and more with Jax. Clay warns Jax that if Jax does not drop the subject of Donnaâ€™s death, Clay will kill him. When a L.O.A.N. car bomb nearly kills Chibs, Clay demands the SAMCRO retaliate immediately. This was L.O.A.N.â€™s intention, and several members of the MC, including Clay, Jax, Bobby, and Tig, are arrested in a botched attempt to attack Ethan Zobelle. While in jail, Agent Stahl from the ATF returns in an attempt to get SAMCRO to rat out their IRA connections. Although they don't give up the IRA, Stahl succeeds in provoking Clay and Jax into a physical confrontation in jail. Out on bail, the divisions in the club only get worse, with the members at each other's throats over everything and everybody doubting one another's loyalty. Further complicating matters is SAMCROâ€™s suspicion (later confirmed) that their IRA contacts are starting to sell guns to L.O.A.N. instead of the MC and increasing pressure from the Mayans, who are receiving free guns from L.O.A.N. in order to wage war on the Sons of Anarchy. When Luann is later murdered, presumably by rival porn producer Georgie Caruso, Clay holds Jax personally responsible. The tension between Jax and Clay reached a breaking point when the porn studio burned down shortly after Clay announced that he wanted SAMCRO out of the porn business. Jax initially believed that Clay had the place torched (it was actually L.O.A.N.) and announced that he was going to "go nomad," which meant that while he'd still be a member of the Sons of Anarchy, he would no longer be a part of any particular chapter of the club. Most of the SAMCRO members were upset with Jax's decision but ultimately voted in favor of him going nomad. After the vote, Gemma had Jax and Clay sit down in her home and revealed that Zobelle's people had raped her. As Jax leaves her house, he takes back his SAMCRO tag, symbolizing his intent to stay in Charming rather than go nomad.

Gemma's revelation brings Jax and Clay back together. The two inform the other member of SAMCRO what happened to Gemma and the MC begins to plan their revenge. The club, however, nearly falls apart again when Tig, overcome with guilt, confesses to Opie that he murdered Donna because Agent Stahl and the ATF had made it look as though Opie had become a rat. At the same time, Chibs agreed to help Stahl take down the IRA and its head, Jimmy O, who is in town to repair the IRA's relationship with SAMCRO and who Chibs had a long and dark history with. Based on information supplied by Chibs, the ATF was able to apprehend Edmond Hayes, who they then wanted to use to apprehend his father, Cameron, and Jimmy O. Opie later witnessed Chibs leaving a meeting with the ATF and informed the club of what he saw but asked them to confront Chibs before acting. Chibs, already having doubts about becoming an informant, revealed to the club what he did after having a heart-to-heart talk with Gemma.

Meanwhile, it the Sons learn that Ethan Zobelle's true intentions were not racially motivated but were to get in business with the Mayans on the prison heroin trade. The MC was able to exploit this information when they reveal it to AJ Weston, who was deeply committed to his racial beliefs and would not tolerate doing business with the Hispanic Mayans. This caused a split between AJ and Zobelle. Unfortunately for the club, they were not initially able to capitalize on this split as their first attempts to take down Weston and Zobelle were thwarted by Deputy Chief Hale. First, AJ Weston was arrested in connection with the fire at Luann's porn studio. Later, Hale arrives at Impeccable Smokes as the Sons are confronting Zobelle. In attempt to save his and his daughter's lives, Zobelle informed the police that he was in possession of narcotics and is arrested. However, both were released by custody and Unser learns that Zobelle, unbeknownst to both the ATF and Weston, has actually been an F.B.I. informant for the past three years. With the loss of Weston's support, Zobelle turned to the Mayans for protection. Weston, however, was on his own and was eventually gunned down by Jax.

Agent Stahl continued to hold Edmond Hayes in an attempt to use Edmond to lure and arrest his father. Cameron, knowing the situation his son was in, told Edmond that he needed to kill Stahl. Edmond had a gun stashed at the safe house he was staying at and tried to shoot Stahl but was unable to pull the trigger on her. However, the ATF was already aware of the gun's presence and Stahl informed Edmond that they had loaded it with blanks. Edmond then attempted to escape ATF custody but was gunned down by Stahl. Shortly afterward, Polly Zobelle, Ethan's daughter who had been having an affair with Edmond, arrived at the safe house. She had been followed there by Gemma. At the safe house, Gemma shot and killed Polly. Stahl witnessed the shooting and let Gemma escape but then proceeded to frame her for Edmond's shooting. After learning of Edmond's death from a police scanner that said Gemma killed Edmond, Cameron broke into Jax's home, tied up Tara, stabbed Half-Sack, who was assigned to protect Tara, and kidnapped Abel.

Meanwhile the rest of the Sons had ambushed Zobelle and the Mayans forcing the Mayans to retreat while Zobelle fled on his own. The Sons followed him to a Deli some distance along the highway, possibly the next town over. Zobelle attempts to hide himself amongst children who had just arrived off of a school bus. The Sons chose to wait until the children had left before making their move on Zobelle, who has called Deputy Hale only to be told his daughter was found murdered and that he would be sending officers to assist him. After getting off the phone with Zobelle, Hale instructed his department to ignore what he had said to Zobelle.

Earlier, Tara called Jax to tell him Gemma was on the run only to be interrupted by Cameron. Concerned, Jax returned to his home where he discovers the body of Half-Sack (actor Johnny Lewis wished to move on.) Distraught, Jax notices Tara is no where to be found and frantically searches the house for her only to find her tied up and gagged next to Abel's crib. After ungagging her Tara tells Jax that Abel was taken by Cameron. Jax calls Clay who returns to help track down Cameron without killing Zobelle. The Sons pursue Cameron who makes his way to the docks where he takes Abel and boards his boat. Chief Unser, after receiving a phone call from Gemma, is last seen driving in his police cruiser with her past Charming's city limits, apparently running off with her. Ethan Zobelle is seen quickly getting on a chartered plane back to Budapest without his dead daughter, Polly. The season ends with The Sons arriving just as Cameron is leaving the docks with Clay comforting a sobbing Jax.

MAIN CHARACTERS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clarence "Clay" Morrow (Ron Perlman) is SAMCRO's current president and youngest original member. He has been married to Gemma since the death of her first husband John Teller in 1993. Clay has been shown to struggle with his age and developing arthritis, frequently allowing Jax to handle Club affairs. According to Gemma, Clay has done time (as did her first husband John). The role was played by Scott Glenn in the first version of the pilot.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jackson "Jax" Teller (Charlie Hunnam) is SAMCRO's vice-president. Born in 1978 to John and Gemma Teller, he has lived his whole life in Charming. His day job is mechanic at Teller-Morrow. He has past arrests for smuggling and gun-running but has been clean since approximately 2003. Having recently discovered several of his father's old journals and an old manuscript entitled The Life and Death of Sam Crow: How the Sons of Anarchy Lost Their Way, which collectively lay out the original manifesto for SAMCRO, he finds himself doubting the club's direction, causing friction between himself and his stepfather Clay, as well as casting doubt to the other members. Jax has a child named Abel, who has radically altered Jax's mentality as he begins to focus on the "big picture" and being a father to Abel in the future, making him much more cautious. Jax has romantic ties to Abel's mother Wendy and his high-school sweetheart Tara.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bobby "Elvis" Munson (Mark Boone Junior) is SAMCRO's treasurer. He does Elvis impersonations in Lake Tahoe. Munson is Jewish. He is a demolition and explosives expert. He was incarcerated for the murder of Brenan Hefner after a woman that lived in the building witnessed the killing and went to the police. He was released a few months after Jax threatened the witness into leaving California and the case against him was based completely on the witness's testimony.

Bobby's father was a mob accountant in Reno, who kept two sets of books for the mob â€“ Bobby apparently learned accounting from his father.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Alex "Tig" Trager (Kim Coates) is SAMCRO's sergeant-at-arms. He is particularly close to Clay, and is one of the club's more violent members, who has on occasion mentioned other disturbing parts of his past. Though respecting Jax's intelligence Tig questions Jax's ability to lead as SOA enters a more brutal era in the Club's history with the Mayans and the Nords. Tig was the one who was to carry out the hit on Opie, but instead mistakenly killed his wife Donna. Afterwards Tig seemed to be in a state of depression and seemingly let Jax beat him after Jax forced him at gun point not to kill the witness who was going to ID Bobby and Opie for the murder of Brenan Hefner.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Filip "Chibs" Telford (Tommy Flanagan) is a member of SAMCRO, and extremely loyal to Jax. He is originally from Glasgow, Scotland, but grew up in Belfast, Northern Ireland and served as a medic with the British Army, however, only lasted 5 months, ending in a court martial. His battlefield experience makes him the Club's medic for backroom emergency surgery. A "chib" is Scottish street slang for a blade. Chibs was seriously injured by a car bomb explosion at the club's garage. He has an estranged wife named Fiona. They have a daughter named Kerrianne
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Piermont "Piney" Winston (William Lucking) is a co-founder of SAMCRO, and father to Opie. He is a veteran of the Vietnam War. He must carry an oxygen tank with him at all times due to emphysema. He is upset with the direction the club is going, especially after Donna's death. In the season one finale, it was revealed that he was given a copy of John Teller's manuscript which he passed on to Jax at Donna's funeral.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harry "Opie" Winston (Ryan Hurst) is a member of SAMCRO, son of co-founder Piney. Best friends with Jax since childhood, Opie's mom took him away from Piney and Charming when he was 16 but he left her and returned to his father and club. Opie had recently been paroled from a five-year stay in prison, following his conviction for a botched robbery with ex-member Kyle Hobart. Now struggling to support his family earning "clean" money through his job at a local lumber mill, he faces conflicting pressure from his wife Donna, who wants him to leave the club, and from SOA members, due to his reluctance to participate in their frequently illegal activities. Facing a deteriorating marriage he has begun to participate in all of SOA's activities to end the "half in" mentality he had taken regarding his devotion to his family and to SAMCRO. His wife, Donna was recently killed during a botched hit against him, after the ATF set him up as a "snitch" against the club in an attempt to break open Samcro.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Juan Carlos "Juice" Ortiz (Theo Rossi) is the club's hacker and intelligence officer. Though Juice displays great technical prowess, he has also proven to be somewhat simple minded when it comes to other tasks, often garnering him hazing from the other members.

He is also in charge of club surveillance, and manages some of the club's intelligence and communication. He is seen as unreliable by Clay Morrow, the club President, and is often given the menial tasks such as driving the transport truck. He sports a short mohawk and has lightning bolts tattooed on each side of his head. He is also the only known full patch member of the club not to have the club's logo tattooed on his back.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Otto Delaney (Kurt Sutter), known as Big Otto Delaney, is a member of the Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club, but is imprisoned in Stockton state prison. Delaney was born in Colma, California on September 29, 1963 and was a member of the Sons of Anarchy's Charming chapter. He is currently imprisoned on charges of second-degree murder and vehicle theft, but is still in contact with the club. He seems to be a powerful man on the inside, and is the leader of the "Big House Crew", a gang made up of imprisoned Sons of Anarchy. His "old lady" is Luann, (now deceased) with whom he was deeply in love. He has her name tattooed on his arm.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Happy (David LaBrava) is a member of the Tacoma charter of the club. He stated in the episode "Better Half" that his sick mother lives in Bakersfield, and that he is thinking of going "nomad" (a nomad is a member of a motorcycle club with no fixed address, and thus no charter affiliation) for awhile to take care of her. Clay's response to that statement was "There's always a seat at that table for you."

In addition to the Redwood Chapter, many other members of SOA are seen throughout the series. Among them are other nomads seen with Happy while attacking Darby's meth lab and the members of other chapters attending Donna's funeral. Also, Clay and Jimmy O have mentioned a chapter in Belfast, Ireland that helps the IRA directly with muscle; they are headed by a man named McGee.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kyle Hobart (Brian Van Holt) Kyle was excommunicated from the club after abandoning Opie during a robbery, leading to Opie's five-year incarceration. With Clay's blessing, he returned to Charming to see his teenage son and ended up trying to offer SAMCRO a business deal involving stolen goods, which was to serve as repayment for his past mistakes. Opie confronted Kyle and the two settled their beef, but it was discovered that Kyle refused a club mandate to remove his Sons of Anarchy back tattoo, so he was given a choice of removal methods ("Fire or knife?"). Choosing fire, the tattoo was burned off of Kyle's back with a cutting torch. Despite losing consciousness during the process, it is unknown if Kyle was still alive after being left on the steps of St. Thomas hospital, where his ex-wife April was waiting to aid him after being tipped off by Gemma that Kyle would likely need medical care.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Gemma Teller Morrow (Katey Sagal) is the queen of Charming. A Machiavellian schemer and expert in psychological manipulation, Gemma is the wife of Clay Morrow and the widow of John Teller. Jax and Abel Teller are her son and grandson, respectively. Gemma is extremely protective of her son and grandson, and she longs for the day when Jax will, in her eyes, be ready to assume control over SAMCRO in order to ensure the organization's survival for another generation. She adores her husband, Clay, and does her best to make things work out his way.

Dr. Tara Knowles (Maggie Siff) is Jax's on-again, off-again love interest. She was Jax's high-school girlfriend, and during this era she got a crow tattoo on her lower back. She left town when Jax was 19, trying to get away from small-town life and the heavy-handed influence of the club. She moved back to Charming after becoming a doctor and now works as a pediatric resident at the local hospital, St. Thomas, and lives in her childhood home, which was left to her by her father when he died. A capable physician, she often tended to Jax's gravely ill infant son, Abel, during the infant's hospitalization and provided emergency medical care to Cameron Hayes after he was shot during the attempt on Clay's life. She and Gemma started out bad terms while also grudgingly respecting each other. After L.O.A.N.'s attack on Gemma, however, their relationship improved due to Tara's vow to keep the incident a secret from the rest of the gang, including Jax, and her continual moral and medical support for Gemma. Tara and Wendy also have a surprisingly cooperative relationship given their conflicting feelings for Jax. Gemma accidentally broke Tara's nose after Tara unintentionally startled Gemma. However, one of Tara's superiors alluded to Tara that she believed Jax was responsible for Tara's injury and warned her to reconsider her involvement with Jax and his lifestyle.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wendy Case (Drea de Matteo) is Jax Teller's estranged wife and the mother of his son, Abel Teller. She is a drug addict who used massive amounts of methamphetamine during her pregnancy. After learning the reasons for her grandson's birth defects, Gemma gave her drugs and the instructions to commit suicide via overdose. Gemma threatened that if Wendy did not obey, she would use her ex-daughter-in-law's drug addiction to ensure she never have any contact with her son. She went to rehab and spent time in a sober living facility. Wendy longed to reunite with Jax, believing that the stability of her family would assist her recovery. Gemma, desiring to destroy her son's relationship with Tara, promised to help Wendy reunite with Jax. After a rift between Tara and Jax and the murder of Donna Winston, Jax and Wendy reconciled and were seen to make love. She was last seen at Donna's funeral watching Tara kiss Jax.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cherry (Taryn Manning) is a girl from Nevada whose real name is Rita. After leaving her abusive husband and burning down their condo, she aligned herself with the Devils Tribe (a friendly independent MC, now "patched over" to the Sons of Anarchy) and called herself Cherry (after her beloved dead dog), posing as a "hangaround". She took an interest in Half-Sack when SAMCRO came to visit, but slept with Clay, who wanted to punish Half-Sack for voicing his sexual attraction to Gemma. Cherry later came to Charming seeking Half-Sack and began dating him after gaining permission from Gemma and clearing up what happened between her and Clay at the Devils Tribe patch-over party. While investigating the club, Agent Stahl learned of Cherry's crimes in Nevada and tried to use her crimes in Nevada as leverage to make her "rat out" SAMCRO. Jax broke her out and helped her escape California, after she made love one last time with Half-Sack.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mary Winston (Julie Ariola) is Piney Winston's ex-wife and the mother of Opie. She moved away from Charming and took Opie with her after divorcing. However, she returned to temporarily look after her grandchildren when Opie was arrested. She is shown consoling the distraught Piney after Donna's murder.

In season 2, she takes a larger role by being the caretaker for her grandchildren since Opie has become emotionally distant since Donna's murder. However, this proves too much for her, so she drops the kids off with Opie and takes all of her belongings and leaves Charming once again. Mary was last seen in the SAMCRO clubhouse, where all of the relatives of the club members are staying for safety reasons.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lyla (Winter Ave Zoli) is a pornstar employed by Luann Delaney and is introduced in Season 2. She and Opie began to grow close after they first met. Like Opie, Lyla is a single parent and she helps him with his children. Opie's involvement with Lyla was not entirely welcome by some, particularly Gemma and Tara, who initially were unable to look past Lyla's profession. After Opie learned the truth about Donna's death, he made peace with his club mates then went to Lyla's house and slept with her. She was last seen sheltered in the SAMCRO clubhouse with other relatives of the club members seemingly suggesting that she is now Opie's 'old lady.'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fiona Larkin (Bellina Logan) is Chibs' estranged wife who is introduced in Season 2. Fiona first appeared at Chibs' bedside when he was hospitalized after nearly being killed by a car bomb. Fiona's presence instantly made it clear to the Sons that IRA member Jimmy O'Phelan was in Charming and that Chibs' life was in danger. It was revealed that years before, Jimmy O'Phelan ran Chibs' out of the IRA back in Belfast and subsequently married Fiona and adopted Chibs' daughter himself. The reason for Chibs expulsion from the IRA is never revealed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wayne Unser (Dayton Callie) is the Chief of the Charming Police Department. He also owns Unser Shipping, a trucking company, and is not above using the SOA for protection and other questionable activities related to his business. He is an ally of Clay Morrow, a longtime resident of Charming, and cares for the town deeply. He seems to think that SOA is good for Charming, or at least a necessary evil. He is suffering from cancer, which is forcing him into retirement, something Clay Morrow does not want to see. In the episode "Hell Followed" it is revealed that Unser is "married to a dark-skinned woman" when he confronts Darby at the jail house. He has two daughters, and is a USMC veteran. His use of marijuana for relief of cancer pain has been revealed recently as well. He has known Gemma from the time she was twelve years old as she has a long history of clashing with the law. He cares about Gemma in a fatherly fashion. His voice sounds quite a bit like Milton Berle's.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
David Hale (Taylor Sheridan) is the Deputy Chief of the Charming Police Department. Chief Unser nicknames him "Captain America" for his black and white views and squeaky clean image (prior to his involvement with L.O.A.N., and sexual encounter with an ATF agent) adherence to the law, and possibly because of his square jawed all-American looks. He is a native of Charming, California, who knew of SAMCRO while he was growing up and who delivered newspapers to the Teller household. His father was a county judge and a very powerful and wealthy man. David also has an older brother, Jacob, Jr. He is next in line for the Chief job once Wayne Unser retires. Unlike Unser, Hale wishes to purge the town of SAMCRO upon becoming Chief of Police.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sheriff Victor "Vic" Trammel (Glenn Plummer) is the local County Sheriff, and in addition to being on the payroll of SAMCRO, he appears to have a great deal of insider information on their illicit activities. In season one, Vic's partner is killed by members of a extreme right-wing militia who used guns supplied by SAMCRO. Afterwards, Vic told Jax he was done with the club but Jax reminded him that the only way one of them is out is if the other is dead and promised to deal with the militia, who also presented a threat to SAMCRO since, if they were captured, could name the MC as the source for guns. In season two he was critically injured in a shooting while pulling over a person in order to frame them for drug possession, a favor for SAMCRO. His current status is unknown.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Agent June Stahl (Ally Walker) is a Federal ATF agent investigating the Club's involvement in arms trafficking when Deputy Chief Hale calls in the ATF in retaliation because Chief Unser did not retire as previously expected. She is obsessed with proving to all that she is tough. She unnerves her male fellow law enforcement officers with her swaggering arrogance and tendency to regard them as sex objects, exhibiting a sort of role reversal of typically masculine attitude. Stahl becomes involved in an affair with Deputy Chief David Hale during her investigation of SAMCRO but calls off the investigation and is shunned by Hale when she inadvertently causes the murder of Donna Winston.

Stahl returns to Charming in the second season, but as part of a larger national investigation into the IRA's operations.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ethan Zobelle (Adam Arkin) is the head of the League of American Nationalists ("L.O.A.N."), a white separatist gang who desires to gain a legitimate foothold in Charming and force SAMCRO out. In the beginning of season two, Zobelle moved into Charming and presented himself to the townspeople and local law enforcement as the owner of the newly opened Impeccable Smokes cigar shop on the town's Main Street. Zobelle was introduced to Deputy Chief Hale though Hale's older brother, Jacob, who hoped to benefit financially from Zobelle's help and the removal of SAMCRO from Charming. Zobelle presented himself as being a means to get SAMCRO out of Charming. Deputy Chief Hale, noting that he knew of Zobelle's racial beliefs, initially refused Zobelle's assistance. Simultaneously, Zoebelle almost immediately tried to undermine SAMCRO's iron-fisted rule over the town and threatened dire consequences against the club if they ignored his warnings. He made it clear that his mission was to stop SAMCRO from selling guns to minority gangs and to take over their territory by trying to bring down the MC at any cost, no matter what method his gang has to use. After Clay refused to stop selling to minorities, Ethan had Clay's wife, Gemma, brutally raped and beaten; she was instructed to tell Clay what happened and to stop his dealings with minorities or she would be assaulted again. This did not have the desired effect, as Gemma did not tell Clay of the rape. Deputy Chief Hale, determined to get SAMCRO out of Charming, starts to open himself to Zobelle's help. When Zobelle proposed that they bring in drugs to Charming to undermine the residents' confidence in SAMCRO, Hale is first angered by the idea. Undeterred, with Zobelle and L.O.A.N.'s backing, Darby and the Nords began producing and selling meth. SAMCRO discovered that the Nords were selling meth and tipped Hale off to the location of Darby's meth lab. When Hale visited the lab site, he said he would come back with a warrant. However, he instead told Unser that nothing was wrong. With that, Unser and Clay both knew that Hale was working with Zobelle (or, at least, turning a blind eye towards Zobelle's activities). But when Unser told Hale about Gemma's rape at the hands of Zobelle's group, and when Zobelle attempted to force Hale into action by giving him a disc containing a video of Ernest Darby seemingly handing Hale a bribe (actually an envelope with a coupon to Impeccable Smokes), Hale changed his mind about accepting Zobelle's help.

Throughout season 2, Zobelle and his henchman made several more attempts to remove SAMCRO from Charming, but all were relatively unsuccessful.

Zobelle's dangerous game of cat-and-mouse with SAMCRO came to an end when the bikers were able to convince A.J. Weston that Zobelle was working behind the brotherhood's back by dealing in the gun and heroin trades with the Mayans. Weston killed high-ranking L.O.A.N. member Ule and assaulted/threatened Zobelle, but ended up being arrested for the arson attack on SAMCRO's pornography studio. With the help of Chief Unser, SAMCRO used the moment of confusion to corner the L.O.A.N. leader and his daughter in their cigar shop. Before Clay could execute Zobelle, Hale and other officers showed up at the scene. To avoid impending death, Zobelle revealed a heroin stash and told the officers that he and his daughter were drug dealers and the two were arrested before the bikers could do anything.
In the season two finale, it was revealed that Zobelle was a long-time F.B.I. informant, so he and his daughter were set free. With protection provided by the Mayans, Zobelle was escorted to his cigar shop where he and his daughter waited for an opportunity to flee Charming to avoid SAMCRO's wrath. Polly left to say goodbye to Edmond Hayes, but when she didn't return, Zobelle reluctantly left her behind. SAMCRO ambushed the Mayan convoy, but Zobelle escaped, seeking refuge in a deli occupied by school children. He attempted to call Hale for assistance, but Hale brushed him off and merely informed him of Polly's death. Zobelle's life was miraculously spared when a more pending issue caused the Sons to depart. He was last seen booking a flight out of Charming.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Polly Zobelle (Sarah Jones) was the scheming daughter and accomplice of Ethan Zobelle. She was the one who initially tricked and subdued Gemma prior to her rape; she also rigged the car bomb which nearly killed Chibs. Deputy Hale extorted her to get information about her father's whereabouts, but she fed him partially false information which had extreme repercussions for SAMCRO. Polly also engaged in an affair with Edmond Hayes. Although it initially appeared that Polly's motive was to secure the IRA's gun connection for L.O.A.N., it was later revealed that Polly's interest in Edmond was genuine and that her father did not entirely approve of the affair. Polly and her father were later arrested for possession of narcotics, a crime which her father alerted Deputy Chief Hale to in order to escape an attack from SAMCRO. In the season two finale, Polly and her father were released from police custody due to her father's F.B.I. informant status. Before fleeing Charming, she went to say goodbye to Edmond Hayes, but found him shot to death in his home. She drew her gun after hearing a noise made by Agent Stahl, who was hiding in the next room, but coincidentally Gemma Teller, who had been following Polly, snuck in the front door at the same time. Gemma told Polly to put down her gun, but Polly pointed the gun at Gemma and Gemma shot her dead. Then Stahl came out of hiding and framed Gemma for the murder of Edmond.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.J. Weston (Henry Rollins) is the muscle, or street leader, of the League of American Nationalists (also known as "LOAN"), a white separatist gang trying to gain control in Charming and force SAMCRO out. Weston is an extremely violent ex-convict who carries out the brutal attacks on SAMCRO orchestrated by the LOAN commander, Ethan Zobelle. Weston's direct connection to the Aryan Brotherhood makes him dangerous since he can provide manpower to his gang wanting to sell weapons and drugs to the residents of Charming (SAMCRO disdains hard drugs and protects their town from drug dealers). Weston is the father of two sons, ages 6 and 10, and has a number of tattoos, including an Algiz just below his neck which is visible through the open collar of his shirts. He and several other men, while wearing white masks, raped Gemma Teller in a warehouse to strike back at Clay for refusing to stop his gun dealings with minorities. Gemma realized that AJ was the leader of the group of men who attacked her after recognizing his Algiz tattoo. He was later seen at a church meeting run by LOAN. There the group laid a trap for SAMCRO, mistakenly believing this was their headquarters, and with intent to kill Zobelle. As the Sons of Anarchy stormed into the church, Zobelle gave a signal, and Weston began open firing on SAMCRO with a hidden weapon, making it look on camera that the group shot first. As church goers fled in a panic, Weston and Zobelle escaped the SAMCRO assailants and watched as they were cuffed and taken away by the police.

Things unraveled for Weston late in season two, when SAMCRO revealed to him that Zobelle was secretly dealing heroin with the Mayans. After finding out the truth and feeling betrayed, he killed Ule and confronted Zobelle. Jax had child services take Weston's children away from him and upon learning this, Weston challenged Jax to a fight to death out in the forest. At the showdown, A.J. and his Aryan brothers attempted to fight dirty, but were overwhelmed by SAMCRO who had secretly enlisted the help of the Niners and the Triads. Charming police scared off most of the gang members before anyone was killed and Deputy Chief Hale arrested Weston on the charge of arson for burning down Luann's porn studio.

In the season two finale, A.J. Weston was released from police custody due to insufficient evidence. Jax, Opie, and Chibs were able to track Weston down and corner him and his youngest son in the bathroom of a tattoo parlor. Seeing the writing on the wall, Weston's last request was that his son not see what was about to happen to him, warned his son never to talk about what happened with anyone, and when his son left, Weston entered a stall and allowed Jax to execute him with a silenced pistol.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ule (Jason Matthew Smith) is a member of the League of American Nationals (L.O.A.N.). He has an antagonistic and distrustful relationship with A.J. Weston, feeling that as Zobelle's right hand man, Weston's ardent white supremacist beliefs are not allowing the L.O.A.N. to broaden their horizons. Recently, Ule has been seen taking Weston's place in the L.O.A.N.'s covert activities with the Mayans. When A.J. Weston found out about the drug trade with the Mayans, enraged, he killed the female heroin cookers and executed Ule.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Marcus Ãlvarez (Emilio Rivera) is the head of the Mayans MC, an Oakland-based rival biker club that has allied itself with the Nordics in order to break SAMCRO's iron-fisted control over the town.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Esai Ãlvarez (Kevin Alejandro) was a member of the Mayans MC and the son of Marcus Alvarez. Marcus selected his son to perform hits on both the Nords leader Ernest Darby and SAMCRO leader Clay Morrow, but Esai and his men botched both hits. He was killed by SAMCRO member Happy, who stabbed him in the back of the head with an icepick. Marcus sanctioned the hit in a jail house deal with Clay in exchange for SAMCRO selling guns to the Mayans.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cameron Hayes (Jamie McShane) is McKeavey's cousin and also a member of the True IRA. He becomes SAMCRO's new contact and gun runner after McKeavey's death. Cameron also gave back the $200,000 and gave SAMCRO a month of free guns for killing the Port Authority Commissioner. He is wanted on four continents. After being shot during an attempt on Clay's life, Tara patched him back up and Happy smuggled him, along with Cherry, into Canada.

Hayes returns in season 2 as SAMCRO's new firearm supplier. He and his partner/son Edmond Hayes made a deal to exclusively sell rifles to SAMCRO, but later break this deal by cutting their supply to SAMCRO and secretly selling to the L.O.A.N., all without the authorization of True IRA leader, Jimmy O'Phelan. After Edmond is captured by the ATF, Cameron evaded the authorities while still dealing guns to the Aryans from a speedboat docked in Charming.

After SAMCRO discovered the Hayes' betrayal and the ATF's active investigation of the IRA by ATF Agent Stahl, they informed O'Phelan who promised to rectify the situation. SAMCRO also used the information to their advantage by framing Cameron and his son as the source of leaks to the ATF about O'Phelan's operations, when the source was really SAMCRO's own member Chibs, who was coerced by Stahl.

In the second season finale, Edmond, working against his will for the ATF, was ordered by Cameron to kill Stahl to re-prove their loyalty to the IRA. The plan backfired when it was revealed that Stahl had anticipated this and loaded Edmond's gun with blanks. When Edmond hits her and attempts to flee her custody, Stahl accidentally shoots him to death. While eavesdropping on the ATF's radio traffic, Cameron finds out about his son's death, but hears Stahl falsely report Gemma Teller as the shooter, prompting Cameron to fly into a grievous rage against SAMCRO. Cameron tailed Half-Sack back to Jax's house where he confronted Tara and Half-Sack at gunpoint before threatening to kill Jax's infant son, Abel, with a kitchen knife. When Half-Sack tried to stop him Cameron stabbed him to death instead. Cameron then tied up Tara and kidnapped Abel. The finale ended with Cameron taking Abel aboard his speedboat and fleeing Charming while Jax and Clay helplessly watched from the docks.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Edmond Hayes (Callard Harris) is Cameron Hayes' son and business partner. Throughout the second season he is shown to have as much clout in the business as his father, often making deals/judgment calls on his own. When Cameron started dealing with the L.O.A.N., Edmond began a sexual relationship with Polly Zobelle. Their relationship deepened into love as time went on. In the episode "Balm", Edmond is arrested by the ATF, based on information supplied by Chibs. In the season two finale, Edmond made contact with his father, who told him he must kill Agent Stahl to prove his loyalty to the IRA. Edmond retrieved a hidden gun in his home, but couldn't bring himself to kill Stahl. Stahl revealed that the gun was loaded with blanks and that the ATF had known about Cameron's plan all along. Feeling like a fool, Edmond punched Stahl and attempted to escape, but Stahl was able to fire several shots from her own sidearm and accidentally killed Edmond. Stahl then framed Gemma for Edmond and Polly Zobelle's murders.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Michael McKeavey (Kevin Chapman) was a member of the True IRA who helped sell illegal weapons through the Sons of Anarchy. McKeavey was beaten to death by the port commissioner who broke his neck and left him for dead after a deal went bad. His date of birth was April 1, 1966.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James O'Phelan (Titus Welliver), better known as "Jimmy O" is the leader of the True IRA group who sell guns to SAMCRO. Jimmy O made his first appearance in Season 2 to personally rectify the Hayes' betrayal of SAMCRO since the True IRA has long been dependent on the Sons Of Anarchy's Belfast chapter.

O'Phelan also shares a long history with Chibs as it was he who kicked Chibs out of the IRA and banished him from Ireland. He then married Chibs' wife, Fiona, and adopted his daughter Carrie Ann. Jimmy is also responsible for the scars on Chibs face. When Jimmy O arrives in Charming to repair the True IRA's relationship with SAMCRO, he personally meets with Chibs and demands that he set up a meeting with Clay. Chibs initially refuses, because of his personal feelings for Jimmy, even though the meeting is in the clubs best interest. Then Jimmy O threatens Fiona's life and insinuates that he has taken a sexual interest in Chibs' daughter. It is unlikely that he would carry out the threat, as his relationship with Fiona seems good, on the surface at least. Chibs however is blinded by anger and this is used by Agent Stahl to talk Chibs into ratting out the IRA. Chibs gives up the info about the warehouse. He Later avoids capture by the ATF and gives SAMCRO the guns meant for LOAN for free due to Cameron and Edmond's betrayal.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ernest Darby (Mitch Pileggi) is the head of the Nordics (also known as "Nords"), a white supremacist gang, mainly involved in meth trafficking. He is not as vicious as Ethan and AJ, and employs people of color. This is noticed and not appreciated by AJ, who tells him to cover up his swastika tattoo, as he feels Darby hasn't "earned it". Later Darby is doublecrossed and left to die by AJ Weston.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Uncle" Jury (Michael Shamus Wiles) is the head of the friendly Devil's Tribe MC chapter in Indian Hills, Nevada. Jury and John Teller served together in the same platoon in Viet Nam and remained close friends thereafter. After the Devil's Tribe is patched over, Jury is now the Head of the Sons of Anarchy Indian Hills chapter.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Laroy (Tory Kittles) is SAMCRO's contact in the One Niners street gang. Laroy buys weapons from SAMCRO. The fictional One Niners gang also appeared in The Shield. It is unclear whether or not SAMCRO is still allied with the One Niners, due to Laroy's double-crossing in a deal to eliminate some of the Mayans, including Marcus Alvarez. This is cleared up in season two where it is made clear that Laroy and the Sons are still allied, and the Mayans are not.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Henry Lin (Kenneth Choi) is the leader of a San Francisco-based Triad. He is a Chinese American. His gang was after a man named Chuck who helped run their illegal businesses but eventually stole from them. However, Chuck was being protected by SAMCRO. Lin and Clay Morrow eventually came to an agreement over this; SAMCRO handed Chuck over, and the Triad paid SAMCRO in cash. Lin later traded over Chuck to SAMCRO in negotiations to get new guns from Clay. Lin is likely the one who chopped off most of Chuck's fingers, leaving just one index finger on each hand. Lin meets with Clay and tells Clay that he needs gun and how he'll pay Clay double. In the episode "Fa Guan," Lin makes a deal with Clay saying if Clay gets a case thrown out, then he will open a pipeline for him.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Nate Meineke (Tim De Zarn) is the leader of a local state militia and terrorist group. He served in Vietnam alongside Piney Winston. He and his son, Russell, bought weapons from SAMCRO and used them to ambush a prison convoy and free one of their members. They then planned to go into hiding in Mexico. However, the Sons of Anarchy killed them by bombing their hide out bunker as they had brought heat onto SAMCRO with the shootings.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Russell Meineke (James Harvey Ward) is the son of Nate. He was killed along with his father and the rest of his militia.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
James "Jimmy" Cacuzza (Jeff Wincott) is the leader of a Mafia family. He and his gang buy weapons from SAMCRO. When the Sons of Anarchy hijacked a truck, they gave the contents of it to the Mafia as a good will gesture as their weapon shipment was late.
