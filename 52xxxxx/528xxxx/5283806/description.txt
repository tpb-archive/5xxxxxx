In the early twenty-second century, the starship Enterprise is launched. Her mission is to explore strange new worlds, seek out new life and new civilizations and to boldly go where no humans have gone before. Along with an alien chief medical officer and first officer, this crew with only NASA-level training and what the Vulcans know of local space, begin to explore and begin the legacy set for other Enterprise crews and captains like Robert April, Christopher Pike, James Kirk, John Harriman, Rachel Garrett, Jean-Luc Picard, William Riker, Edward Jellico and others.
===============================================================================
SEASON ONE & TWO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first two seasons of Star Trek: Enterprise depict the exploration of interstellar space by the crew of an Earth ship able to go farther and faster than any humans had previously gone, due to the breaking of the Warp 5 barrier, analogous to the Bell X-1 breaking the sound barrier. The crew faces situations that are familiar to Star Trek fans, but are unencumbered and unjaded by the experience and rules which have built up over hundreds of years of Trek history established in previous Star Trek series. Star Trek: Enterprise takes pains to show the origins of some concepts which have become taken for granted in Star Trek canon, such as Lt. Reed's development of force fields and Captain Archer's questions about cultural interference eventually being answered by later series' Prime Directive.

A recurring plot device is the Temporal Cold War, in which a mysterious entity from the 27th century uses the Cabal, a group of genetically upgraded Suliban, to manipulate the timeline and change past events. Sometimes sabotaging Enterprise's mission and sometimes saving the ship from destruction, the entity's motives are unknown. Agent Daniels, a temporal agent from the 31st century, visits Captain Archer occasionally to assist him in fighting the Suliban and undoing damage to the timeline.

In the past ninety years since Star Trek: First Contact, the Vulcans have been mentoring humanity to what they see as an appropriate level of civilization, routinely holding back scientific knowledge in an effort to keep humans stranded close to home, believing them to be too irrational and emotionally-dominated to function properly in an interstellar community. When Enterprise finally sets out, the Vulcans are often conspicuously close by. This generates some conflict as, in several early episodes, Archer and others complain bitterly of the Vulcans' unsubtle methods of checking up on them.

===============================================================================
SEASON THREE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Low ratings encouraged the series' producers to seek a new direction. In analyzing past Trek movie successes, a storyline where the Earth was put in jeopardy was devised, as such a story had proven popular before, as in Star Trek: First Contact and Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home. The third season also sees the change of the series' name to Star Trek: Enterprise as well as an updated main title theme. Season three introduces the Xindi, an enemy bent on annihilating humanity via a planet-destroying super weapon similar to Star Wars' Death Star.

The third season follows a single story arc, beginning in the second season finale "The Expanse", in which a mysterious probe cuts a wide, deep trench from central Florida to Venezuela, killing seven million people. Enterprise is recalled and retrofitted as a warship, with more powerful weapons and a group of elite Military Assault Command Operations (MACOs). Enterprise travels through an area known as the Delphic Expanse to find the Xindi homeworld and prevent another attack against Earth. The crew learns in "Azati Prime" that the Sphere-Builders, a transdimensional species, have technology that allows them to examine alternate timelines. The Sphere-Builders know that in the 26th century, the "Federation" fleet, led by Enterprise's distant cousin, the Enterprise-J, will lead an attack against them that will defeat them. They wanted the Xindi, who revered them as "the Guardians," to destroy Earth in the hope that this would deter the formation and existence of the Federation. However, in the season finale, "Zero Hour," they manage to defeat the Sphere-Builders and destroy the Xindi weapon. They also succeeded in returning the Expanse to normal space. The season ends with the Enterprise being mysteriously transported into the middle of World War II. This plot was resolved in Storm Front, Part I&II.

===============================================================================
SEASON FOUR
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The show was renewed for a fourth season on May 20, 2004. The renewal moved the show from Wednesday night to Friday night, a move that seemed to replicate the third season renewal of the original Star Trek, when it was moved from Thursday night to the Friday night "death slot." Many cast and crew members supported it, saying that The X-Files gained more viewership during its first three years on Friday nights. As a sequel to "Zero Hour," "Storm Front" and "Storm Front, Part II," opened up the fourth season on October 8 and 15, 2004. The episodes ended the ongoing Temporal Cold War arc, which proved very unpopular among the show's viewers during the first three seasons. The Xindi arc, started over a year ago in "The Expanse," ended with the third episode, "Home," which mostly dealt with Captain Archer's ethically and morally questionable actions during the yearlong mission in the Expanse. The general theme of the season was a refocus on the prequel concept of the series, with many episodes making reference to themes, concepts, and characters from past series. The fourth season saw Brent Spiner (Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation) as the imprisoned scientist Dr. Arik Soong, an ancestor of Data's creator, in a three-episode arc at the end of which Soong abandons the concept of improving mankind in favor of creating artificial intelligence: an allusion to what will eventually become Data.

The Soong episodes later gave rise to a story arc where the Klingons were attempting to improve their species through the continuation of Soong's work. This allowed for an explanation of why the Klingons on The Original Series lacked brow ridges and were much more human looking than any of the other series.

Season 4 also addressed some discrepancies between the Vulcans of The Original Series and those depicted in Star Trek: Enterprise. In the Vulcan Civil War arc, Romulan subversion of the Vulcan High Command leads to a splinter group of Vulcans opposed to the High Command's actions, believing those actions to be against the teachings of Surak, the mythic leader who brought logic to Vulcan. After this storyline, Vulcans began a cultural transformation that was presumably a turn toward the more enlightened Vulcans of Trek series set further in the future. For example, mind-melding before the ancient teachings were recovered was considered immoral; after, it was embraced as the legacy of all Vulcans. A two-part return to the Mirror Universe, made popular by The Original Series and Deep Space Nine, titled "In a Mirror, Darkly," was made late in the fourth season, which take place in the parallel dimension (and to date they are the only ones to do so). These episodes use the Enterprise crew as the most barbaric members of the Terran Empire. As a sequel to the original Star Trek's "The Tholian Web," "Part I," proved popular while "Part II" had an ending which was a cliffhanger. Had the series gone on for a fifth season, the story would have continued. The story was "continued" by means of the first "Mirror Universe" anthology published in 2007 by Pocket Books. The story, "Age of the Empress" was crafted by Mike Sussman, the writer of "In a Mirror, Darkly."

Romulans also stir up trouble midway through the season. While a diplomatic conference is hosted by Earth on the planet Babel, Romulans, using drone ships with holographic emitters (mimicking any ship) stir up trouble with the Andorians and Tellarites. This places the two races at each other's throats, and when they're revealed to be Romulan, Archer devises an alliance, similar to the Federation, with the Vulcans. This three-part arc, which presaged the inevitable Romulan-Earth War of 2156, received the lowest Nielsen ratings of the entire series, leading UPN to cancel it on February 2, 2005.

In the final story arc of the season, a human terrorist group called Terra Prime, bent on removing all non-humans from human planets, genetically engineers a child from DNA samples of Commander Tucker and Commander T'Pol. They use the baby as a means to rile up humans who have become afraid of aliens since the Xindi conflict, and launch a campaign from Mars to drive the alien outsiders from human space. This storyline has been said by producers to represent how humanity must overcome its own bigotry and hatred in order to become the human race seen in later Treks.

The series cancellation was announced prior to the writing of the final episode of the fourth season, allowing the writers to craft a series finale. This final episode, titled "These Are the Voyages...", aired May 13, 2005 in the United States and was one of the most heavily criticized episodes of the Star Trek franchise. Much of the criticism focused on the premise, which essentially reduced the finale to a holodeck adventure from an earlier Star Trek series. This is why many of the cast consider the two-part "Demons" and "Terra Prime" to be the true finale of the series. The episode featured guest appearances by Jonathan Frakes and Marina Sirtis as their Star Trek: The Next Generation characters William Riker and Deanna Troi. The show took place during the TNG episode "The Pegasus". Brent Spiner lent his voice to the finale, and is briefly heard as Data.

MAIN CHARACTERS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jonathan Archer (Scott Bakula) â€” captain of Earth's first Warp 5 starship, Enterprise. His father designed its engine, giving Archer a very personal connection to his ship. Archer feels an immense amount of pressure concerning his mission, especially when hunting the Xindi to save Earth from destruction. Subsequently he is assigned Earth-local or diplomatic missions. Instrumental in founding the Federation.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) â€” originally attached to the Enterprise by the Vulcan High Command to keep the humans out of trouble. Becomes very loyal to Archer, leaving her position in the High Command to accompany him, find the Xindi, and later join Starfleet. A version of T'Pol who was flung into the past gives birth to the first human/Vulcan hybrid. In later seasons, forms a romantic relationship with Trip. DNA stolen, along with Charles Tucker's, in order to make the first Vulcan/Human hybrid in the "normal" timeline, who unfortunately died from complications.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles "Trip" Tucker III (Connor Trinneer) â€” chief engineer of the Enterprise, and long-time friend of Captain Archer. Started off conservatively modest, but becomes more seasoned as the series runs, losing a sister in the Xindi attack. In later seasons, forms a romantic relationship with T'Pol. DNA stolen, along with T'Pol's, in order to make the first Vulcan/Human hybrid in the "normal" timeline, who unfortunately died from complications. Was killed in the series finale based 10 years in the future saving the ship while it was under attack.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Malcolm Reed (Dominic Keating) â€” armory officer of the Enterprise, also in charge of ship security. Reed comes from a long line of Royal Navy men, but joined Starfleet due to a fear of drowning. An extremely taciturn man, his own family did not know his favorite food when asked.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hoshi Sato (Linda Park) â€” communications officer and linguistic genius. Capable of learning alien languages extremely quickly, Hoshi serves as the translator between the Enterprise crew and new alien species, even after the Universal Translator is on-line. Suffered anxiety about her place on board originally, but exposure to frequent danger helped her realize her value to the ship.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Travis Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery) â€” helmsman. A "Space Boomer", Travis is unique on Enterprise being born in space. Son of a freighter captain, Travis knows many of the alien species as well as locations that Earth traders frequent. As Enterprise moves farther and farther from Earth, his value in this area lessens, but his skill at the helm is constantly appreciated, making him the pilot of choice for many missions.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Dr. Phlox (John Billingsley) â€” chief medical officer. A member of the Inter-Species Medical Exchange, Phlox is brought aboard the Enterprise to care for their Klingon passenger. Afterward, he volunteers to stay on, delighting in the experience of humanity taking its first steps into the larger galactic stage. An exceedingly cheerful alien, Dr. Phlox uses many animals and various naturalistic cures to practice his trade, instead of the usual technological implements. Devises a method of eradicating Borg nanoprobes, but because the method is fatal to humans and nearly so to Denobulans, it has little use.
