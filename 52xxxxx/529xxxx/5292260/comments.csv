,Donalddln,2010-01-19T23:10Z,"Thanks, I played the demo and although people were complaining about hard controls, I figured that I would put the mouse sensitivity up and that worked. I was waiting all day and three months for this, lol. It looked so awesome. I seen that they originally were going to make it without the jetpack until that suddenly came up and they had to work on it again to redesign the game to work with it."

P.S.: everything related to flying SUCKED ASS in the demo"
,GATE_Elemental,2010-01-20T02:35Z,Genius says the truth this game is toxic and should not belong inside your Hard Drives!
,MadZalmanModder,2010-01-20T04:18Z,"The worst port from console to pc ever.
No AA for graphics. (it's 2010 already CAPCOM, get with the times. Unreal engine can do AA).   Controls are screwed up.  mouse sensitivity is useless. Character moves too much on screen throwing your aiming perspectives off.

Avoid this like the plague."
,druid513,2010-01-20T04:53Z,"is the graphic bad?  then thats a good news for me, probably my sucky notebook can run this game "
,luck702,2010-01-20T08:25Z,"(sigh). i just want to check the game out, but being a pc only gamer, fucking capcom wont release a pc demo. so its either wait 3 weeks for the dl to finish, or just not try... oh, and btw, fuck you capcom. always hated you...."

,Zandog,2010-01-20T19:24Z,"Please take this into consideration before downloading. I'm a veteran PC gamer and I have DV for PS3. This console to PC port is done without any regard to how it will play on your computer.

Controls:
The game controls are decent, but not great for a console game. They take a huge hit on PC however, as the calibration in a flight/action game like this should be decently suited for both mouse and key as well and a dual analog stick but I have both controls for PC and it doesn't feel even close to the PS3's control. Very awkward and clunky at best.

Graphics:
Honestly, it feels stripped down graphically. On the PS3 it looks more fluid and has a better field of depth. I'm running a top end system (Pi7 920 @ 3.2ghz, 6 gig 1600 ram, NV 285 GTX 2gig that runs anything out atm and with all settings maxed out, still looks lower quality than the console version. As mentioned, it runs in windowed mode with no option for full screen once you change your video settings. With a quick look at your profile in docs/games/capcom, it can be fixed.

Gameplay:
It's Dark Void! Isn't a ""great"" game on console, but it's a decent campaign overall.

Thoughts:
It was like they decided the PC version an after thought and stripped whatever wasn't compatible out. The game looks, plays and feels different on console and frankly, the 2 hrs I tried so hard to like what I did in the console version was wasted. Capcom did a great job porting Streetfighter 4. I'm an open minded gamer and know how to teak and adjust for optimum PC settings, but this game is one of the best examples of how NOT to port a game.

I know you'll d/l it and try it for yourself, but I thought you should know.. "
,JC5891,2010-01-20T22:42Z,"WINDOWED MODE problem fix:
You just need to edit the Defaultengine.ini file found in Capcom\Darkvoid\Nativepc\Skygame\config. Just open it up, Ctrl+F and search up ""Fullscren"" and change the 'FALSE' to TRUE and save.

Make sure to remove its Read-Only file attribute so that you can make this edit and save the .ini, and then you can set it back to read-only if you want."

i downloaded the repack, installed it and it's not working.

i also re-installed .net, c++, physx, i didn't affect, i still can't play. i would be appreciated with your help.

,M0ndos,2010-01-21T03:48Z,"Yeah guys I am getting this error.

'The version of this file is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information to see whether you need an x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version of the program, and then contact the software publisher.'

That is if I just click the disc icon. If I click the .msi I get this:

'This installation package could not be opened.  Contact the application vendor to verify that this is a valid Windows Installer package.'

i agree with u i like capcom games best games ever in terms of fighting but this shit sucks the game and crack are good but the crontrols are very bad i can even gett pass where u gotta take down the ambush the guy is too hard to control with the mouse but i got a pc game controler and it more easy on the controler than the mouse and keyboard"

,wtfronsson,2011-01-19T23:16Z,"game is ugly as shit, controls are horrible, voice acting and characters are boring, fighting is boring as hell. ill rather just play me2 through once more, thank you.

,Eiyer,2011-03-18T00:33Z,"Anyone complaining about the controls is just stupid. There is nothing wrong with the controls you just need a controller to play it, like an Xbox 360 controller for PC. A lot of games need a controller to play. Yes, it would be nice if these games worked flawlessly for the Mouse and Keyboard, but we should just be happy we get these games at all since a lot of companies won't put their games on PC."

,GrimReaperrz,2011-10-26T17:32Z,"no offence to you extremezone your a good guy but this torrent fucks up your physx well it did with mine atleast how i found out: i installed batman arkham asylum and it didn't work cos of the physx error (i had the patch and all that) so i made a clean install of my system (was about time to do that anyway) installed batman arkham asylum and it worked installed other games and again physx error restored back with system restore installed games 1 by 1 testing batman after every install then i installed this game and again physx error

my advice is not to run the setup.exe but to run Dark Void.msi (make sure u have UAC disabled cos u can't run it in admin and files MAY be blocked if u run it with UAC enabled)"
,Cerebral222,2011-11-15T00:33Z,"Works perfectly, thanks for the upload, used xpadder to play this properly. Cheers ExZone"
,DUDE1404,2012-04-29T17:07Z,"Worked well after installation, but when I tried to run it 2nd time it simply won't start. The small window with the game does not respond! F@CK"
