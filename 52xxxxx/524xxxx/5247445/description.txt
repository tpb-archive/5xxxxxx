This is a very good DVD rip of Journey to the Center Of The Earth 2008 at 700MB (I followed a guide (PAKG)to Rip like AXXO) 
It's a great kids film with some interesting twists. 

I now have a fiber connection so downloading will be much faster.

PLEASE SEED

THANK YOU

He decides to follow the steps of Max with Sean and they travel to Iceland, where they meet the guide Hannah Asgeirsson. While climbing a mountain, there is a thunderstorm and they protect themselves in a cave. However, a lightening collapses the entrance and the trio is trapped in the cave.
