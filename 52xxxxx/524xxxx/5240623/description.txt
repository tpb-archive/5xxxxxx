Now you can manage GSM, 3G, and Nextel SIM cards as well as read and recover SMS messages!

Donâ€™t spend your valuable time handling contacts using a phoneâ€™s cumbersome keypad and small display; use your computer and SIM Manager instead.

SIM Manager is an advanced SIM card management tool, which provides an easy way to organize the address-book of a SIM card, as well as process other data stored on the SIM, such as the SMS archive, the list of fixed dialing numbers, last dialed numbers, etc.

SIM Manager allows you to administrate the security codes of a SIM or USIM, by enabling or disabling PIN codes, changing them, or unblocking a blocked SIM card.

With SIM Manager you can backup your SIM cards, and use them if a card was lost or stolen, or when you need to copy the contents of a SIM card needs to another card.

SIM card manager is fully compatible with Nextel and 3G SIM cards, while preserving the compatibility with older GSM cards. This makes it possible to synchronize the contents of different SIM cards when you switch from one mobile network to another.

Synchronization is further extended by SIM Managerâ€™s ability to export the contacts of a SIM to a CSV file, which can be loaded by a mail-client, or a PIM application. Now you can synchronize your Outlook address-book with the phonebook of your SIM, merge the contacts of your phone and PDA, etc.

SIM Manager is a Unicode application, meaning that it can correctly process names and texts that contain characters other than the ones in the Latin alphabet, regardless of the current regional settings of Windows. It makes this GSM, 3G and Nextel SIM card editor suitable for enterprises that have offices in different geographical locations, as traveling from one cultural area to another is now less of a problem.

SIM Manager works directly with the SIM card, using a PC/SC-compliant smart card reader. The program does not require a phone; therefore it is a fact that the solution still works after the phone is upgraded, or when a switch to a different mobile operator is made. There is no need to purchase a special data-cable for your phone either. All of the above-mentioned makes SIM Manager a great one-time investment.
