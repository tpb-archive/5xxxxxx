Wicked City

[DUAL AUDIO / ENGLISH SUBTITLES / COMPLETE]


PLOT: There is Earth, our familiar world, and then there is the Black World,a parallel dimension that very few people are aware of.
For centuries, a pact between the two worlds has been observed to maintain peace, and terms must be negotiated and renewed soon to continue relative harmony.
This time around, there is a militant faction that will stop at nothing to prevent the signing of a new treaty for inter-dimensional peace.
Two agents of the elite organization known as the Black guards - defenders of the balance between the two worlds - are charged with insuring the success of the treaty.

Director Yoshiaki Kawajiri (Ninja Scroll) blends stylish eroticism, graphic horror and pulse-pounding action as these two race to consummate the peace treaty in time.
