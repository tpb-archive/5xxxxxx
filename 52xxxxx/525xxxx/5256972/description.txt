Anyone ever played SubSpace? Continuum is the continuation of this game. Continuum is a multiplayer top-view space game. It features 8 different ships - each with their own unique abilities. The graphics and sound effects of the game are fantastic, and game play manages to keep up with it. Keyboard shortcuts allow for easy access to all the upgrades you have, and you never have to leave the action.

Continuum has different styles of play, and it depends on the server. Some servers have free-for-all death matches, others have team matches, and some have Ã«capture the flagÃ­ games. There is a special Continuum sport, Ã«SoccerÃ­. In Soccer, you pick up the ball, and try to shoot it at the enemyÃ­s goal.
