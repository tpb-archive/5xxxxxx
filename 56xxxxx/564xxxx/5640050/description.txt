COMPILING ON WIN32 WITH MINGW
=============================

NOTE: OUTDATED

1. Download and install MinGW from http://www.mingw.org/.
2. Download http://www.libsdl.org/extras/win32/common/directx-devel.tar.gz
     and untar it into your MinGW directory (usually C:MinGW).

	and copy it over the existing C:MingWincludeGLglext.h.
4. Download and install Python from http://www.python.org/.
5. Download and install SCons from http://www.scons.org/.
6. Download and install libcURL from
7. Download and install the OpenAL SDK from http://www.openal.org.
8. Add the Python installation directory to the system variable %PATH%
9. Download and install Gtk+ 2.10.7 development environment from http://gladewin32.sourceforge.net
10. Set the system variable: PKG_CONFIG_PATH to %GTK_BASEPATH%libpkgconfig
11. Compile XreaL:
	>scons arch=win32-mingw


COMPILING ON GNU/LINUX
======================

You need the following dependencies in order to compile XreaL with all features:

 * SDL >= 1.2
 * FreeType >= 2.3.5
 * OpenAL >= 0.0.8 (if compiled with scons openal=1)
 * libcURL >= 7.15.5 (if compiled with scons curl=1)
 * GTK+ >= 2.4.0 (if compiled with scons mapping=1, requires glib, atk, pango, iconv, etc)
 * gtkglext >= 1.0.0 (if compiled with scons mapping=1)
 * libxml2 >= 2.0.0 (if compiled with scons mapping=1)
 * zlib >= 1.2.0 (if compiled with scons mapping=1)

Compile XreaL for x86 processers:
	>scons arch=linux-i386
Compile XreaL for x86_64 processers:
	>scons arch=linux-x86_64

Type scons -h for more compile options.


COMPILING ON MAC OS X
=====================

NOTE: OUTDATED

Make sure you have libcURL and the SDL framework installed.

Download http://oss.sgi.com/projects/ogl-sample/ABI/glext.h
	and copy it to XreaL/code/renderer

Use the included XCode project to compile XreaL and friends for both PPC & Intel Macs.
The XCode project is located here:
	>code/unix/MacSupport/XreaL.xcodeprj


USING HTTP/FTP DOWNLOAD SUPPORT (SERVER)
========================================

You can enable redirected downloads on your server by using the 'sets'
command to put the sv_dlURL cvar into your SERVERINFO string and
ensure sv_allowDownloads is set to 1.
 
sv_dlURL is the base of the URL that contains your custom .pk3 files
the client will append both fs_game and the filename to the end of
this value.  For example, if you have sv_dlURL set to
"http://xreal.sourceforge.net/", fs_game is "base", and the client is
missing "test.pk3", it will attempt to download from the URL
"http://xreal.sourceforge.net/base/test.pk3"

sv_allowDownload's value is now a bitmask made up of the following
flags:
    1 - ENABLE
    2 - do not use HTTP/FTP downloads
    4 - do not use UDP downloads
    8 - do not ask the client to disconnect when using HTTP/FTP

Server operators who are concerned about potential "leeching" from their
HTTP servers from other XreaL servers can make use of the HTTP_REFERER
that XreaL sets which is "XreaL://{SERVER_IP}:{SERVER_PORT}".  For,
example, Apache's mod_rewrite can restrict access based on HTTP_REFERER. 


USING HTTP/FTP DOWNLOAD SUPPORT (CLIENT)
========================================

Simply setting cl_allowDownload to 1 will enable HTTP/FTP downloads on 
the clients side assuming XreaL was compiled with USE_CURL=1.
Like sv_allowDownload, cl_allowDownload also uses a bitmask value
supporting the following flags:
    1 - ENABLE
    2 - do not use HTTP/FTP downloads
    4 - do not use UDP downloads


MULTIUSER SUPPORT ON WINDOWS SYSTEMS
====================================

  On Windows, all user specific files such as autogenerated configuration,
  demos, videos, screenshots, and autodownloaded pk3s are now saved in a
  directory specific to the user who is running XreaL.

  On NT-based systems such as Windows XP, this is usually a directory named:
    "C:Documents and Settings%USERNAME%Application DataXreaL"

  On Windows Vista, this would be:
    "C:Users%USERNAME%Application DataXreaL"

  Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows ME will use a directory like:
    "C:WindowsApplication DataXreaL"
  in single-user mode, or:
    "C:WindowsProfiles%USERNAME%Application DataXreaL"
  if multiple logins have been enabled.

  You can revert to the old single-user behaviour by setting the fs_homepath
  cvar to the directory where XreaL is installed.  For example:
    xreal.exe +set fs_homepath "c:xreal"
  Note that this cvar MUST be set as a command line parameter.
