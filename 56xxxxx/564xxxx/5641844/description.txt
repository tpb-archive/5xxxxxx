The first track from forthcoming (August 2010) Murderdolls album 'Women And Children Last'- this is 'My Dark Place Alone'!


Lyrics:



GO!

Sick, am I sick?

And for these last five years I've been stuck up in here.
Inside this brain that drains into society, injected in your veins.

Give me hand grenades, give me razor blades,
give me anything to make the pain go away.

Cause these pills don't work, sometimes they make it worse.
And now I'm slowly going down the fucking drain.

The lights are on. But there's no one home.
And I'll sit here in my dark place alone, dark place alone.

I, I don't mind, these side affects of my so called life.
Now I bide, bide my time to infect this world with my, with my fucking mind

The lights are on. But there's no one home.
And I'll sit here in my dark place alone, dark place alone. (ALONE!)

Now I'm sick in the head, in the head motherfucker
Like the living dead, living dead motherfucker
Now I'm sick in the head, in the head motherfucker
Like the living dead, living dead motherfucker

ALONE!

The lights are on. But there's no one home.
And I'll sit here in my dark place alone, dark place alone.(ALONE!)
The lights are on. But there's no one home.
And I'll sit here in my dark place alone, dark place alone.

OH, NO!
