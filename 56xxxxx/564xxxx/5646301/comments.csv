,matthupp,2010-06-23T17:05Z,don't u people learn. wait for a real release
,markoose,2010-06-23T17:06Z,AiTB doesn't upload fake shit just look at how much stuff he's uploaded and the green skull. It's probably the crack and considering 5 of you say it won't work you'd think one of you fuckers would be seeding
,markoose,2010-06-23T17:38Z,If the iso is corrupted this is why it's better to upload in rar's of smaller size so we don't have to download an entire iso again.
,Bjornokiller,2010-06-23T19:27Z,does this work.. and is this with a crack?
,KillTheNoob,2010-06-24T03:12Z,"So, Has anyone been able to get this to work yet? Markoose is probably right and hopefully it is the crack, not something within the iso. I have 1 hour to go so I'll post back if I can get this one to work."

,g0dsize,2010-06-24T14:53Z,"Works perfectly for me.  Downloaded, mounted with Daemon Tools, installed, copied the crack over the original, and fired it right up.  Played through two levels without a hitch.

I read on another forum that you need to set your soundcard quality to 24KHz, and that fixed crashing for some people. No idea if that really works, as I didn't need to do that.

Great upload, great game.  Thanks AiTB for another excellent torrent!"
,g0dsize,2010-06-24T14:57Z,"@ Bjornokiller:  Depending on how you're installing the game, you'll either need to extract the iso to a folder using winrar [or something similar], install, then copy the LEGOHarryPotter.exe of the ""Crack"" folder over to your install directory for the game.

If you're mounting the image to install, browse to the ""Crack"" folder in your virtual disk drive to find the crack file & copy it over the installed one."
,Bjornokiller,2010-06-24T15:03Z,"@g0dsize
i have the game on a dubble layer but this is very new to me i don't know how to copy the crack .."
,g0dsize,2010-06-24T15:10Z,"With the DVD in the drive, browse to the DVD and you'll find a folder called Crack. Inside that folder, you'll find a file called LEGOHarryPotter.exe.  Right click that, select ""copy"", and browse to your install directory [default is C:\Program Files\WB Games\LEGO® Harry Potter?] Paste the file into that folder, overwriting the file already in there when it asks.  Then fire the game up & play."
,Bjornokiller,2010-06-24T15:12Z,okej i am installing it now i will let you know if it works and really thank you for helping me :)

,luisik,2010-06-26T13:25Z,"FOR ALL WHO ARE HAVING CRASH PROBLEMS:
When the game has been corrrectly installed, but it crashes at the beginning, in the desktop, It is only a Sound Card problem, so the only thing you need to do is to set your sound card driver to less quality than 24 bit, 44100 Hz at it will work like a charm.
A beautiful game, by the way.

,unknown_factor,2010-07-05T17:47Z,"For those of you having problems with the last level of year 3, here's a simple fix for you. The problem isn't with the fire blowing statues, it's with the ice door animations that the statues are supposed to melt for you when you shoot them.

Start the level and play through as you normally would. When you're ready to progress just follow these steps:

(Applies to both single and multiplayer)
1. Drop-in a player 2 character if one isn't already playing.
2. Position the player 2 character somewhere well off-screen of the ledge with the ice door (just standing in front of the fountain down below is sufficient enough)
3. Take player 1 up to the first statue. Press fire.
4. IMMEDIATELY DROP PLAYER 1 OUT!
5. After the sound effects finish, drop player 1 back in and head to the second statue. Press fire.
6. IMMEDIATELY DROP PLAYER 1 OUT!
7. Drop player 1 back in. Drop player 2 out. And viola! Continue on as normal!

The premise behind this being, if the animation for the door melting is never on screen your graphics cards has no need to process it, thereby skipping the animation.

NOTE: You will have to do this every time you play this level.

Hope that helps!"
,real4xor,2010-07-05T17:53Z,"LEGO harry potter is bugged by EA.
It would seem for yet unknown reasons LEGO Harry Potter crashes if your (system) sound quality settings are higher than 48kHz.

So if your game crashes on startup, with or without crack, try lowering sound quality in control panel."
,elmoandzoey,2010-07-07T10:39Z,"@unknown_factor thanks for that trick! It's annoying you have to do that but it works like a charm.
