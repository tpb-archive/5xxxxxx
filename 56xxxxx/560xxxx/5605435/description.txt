Virtualize your CDs, DVD, HD DVDs and Blu-ray Discs and get the fastest possible access to your data, both locally and over the network. Virtual CD creates images of your optical media, so you can use them at any time without having the physical medium on hand. Your data is available exactly as if the medium was in the drive, without the disadvantages attendant, for example, on network shares. The images created can be stored on a server to enable simultaneous access by multiple users. When creating an image, you have the option of selecting the level of compression and, if desired, even encryption. You get maximum availability of your data, while lost, damaged and stolen media become a thing of the past. With a simple left click on the Virtual CD symbol you arrive at the program menu where you can utilize all important Virtual CD functions. If you click on the symbol with the right mouse key, the drive menu opens. Here you can e.g. insert and eject images or insert blank CDs in the virtual burner.


Not only does Virtual CD serve you with its well-engineered ergonomy, but it also keeps the security of your data in mind. To protect sensitive data and to keep files confidential, you can use a virtual DVD RAM blank CD as an encrypted fixed disk with up to 17.5 GB. After entering your password, you can read and write your data on it as if you were using a regular fixed disk. In the background, Virtual CD codes the data on-thy-fly with the safe AES 256bit-encryption without your noticing anything.

What's new in Virtual CD v10.1:
â€¢ Help file with integrated videos; online video library with workshop videos. The extensive online help in Virtual CD now includes videos that give you detailed explanations, in text and images, of the many VCD functions. We are also setting up a library of workshop videos at the VCD website to help you get the most out of Virtual CD.
â€¢ Extended task assignment options. The task assignment dialogs in Virtual CD made version 10 easier to use than its predecessors. In Virtual CD 10.1 even more options have been added to these dialogs, so you can choose from a broader range of tasks to be executed on double-click. Even the selection of post-CD burning actions has been extended.
â€¢ Extended options for desktop drive icons. The drive icons that Virtual CD creates on the desktop are among the most popular features in Virtual CD 10. Especially for USB flash drives and other removable media, these functions mark a tremendous gain in convenience. In the 10.1 update, the display options in this feature have been enhanced.
â€¢ New options in the Image Wizard and Image Writer. Now you can add more files to images. You can also interrupt the creation process and restart it at a later pointâ€”the process picks up where it left off.
â€¢ Improved file system compatibility for VCD images. The image files created by Virtual CD can sometimes exceed the handling capacity of certain file systems. That is why we have now integrated the option of dividing large image files into multiple smaller files. This feature can be enabled globally, so that it is active by default, or individually, while creating an image.

â€¢ Improvements in the CD Control Center and the Editor. The comprehensive filtering and display options have been expanded yet again, so that even large CD collections can be searched quickly and easily for a particular track. In the Editor, working sequences have been further optimized for faster results than ever.
