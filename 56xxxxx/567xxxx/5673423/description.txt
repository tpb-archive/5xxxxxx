This is a reproduced torrent of Papakeno's PapaPop series 61-70.


I want to make it abundantly clear that I have not in any form, shape, or way, been involved in the compilation process of these collections - All of the "Blood, sweat and tears" are Papakenos and not mine. If you like the music, then pay your respects to the man here, make a comment. Just say "Thank you, Papakeno" - it's common courtesy to thank for that which is freely given!

And a simple "Thank you, Papakeno" will suffice to keep the man happy, and keep working on these great music compilations for all of us.

For the rest of Papakeno's PapaPop series or other compilations, check out:

You should check out the ISOTOP collection, created by _Wintermute_ - Very good music in similar style:

Happy Hunting

PS
I work abroad, therefore I will disappear and re-appear at intervals (usually away 6 weeks, home 6 weeks). So if I'm not seeding right now, just be patient, I will return so you can get it downloaded.
