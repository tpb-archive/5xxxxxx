This is the same as the torrent at http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/3547477/NASA_-_Voyager_Recordings_-_Symphonies_of_the_Planets_%281992%29, except that I have converted the FLAC files into MP3 format at 192 kbps, which cuts the size of the download by nearly 55%.  The only difference is that, since the 5th track is corrupted in the original download, I followed the link posted in the comment section by ponkassmonkey (http://www.anus.com/metal/hall/index.php/topic,1739.0.html - all five tracks available there, as well) to download an undamaged copy, and converted that to MP3 instead.

The tracks were made in the early 1990s by converting the radio noise picked up by the Voyager space probes in the outer Solar System into sounds of the same frequencies.  More complete data are available in the booklet in the torrent.

Share and Enjoy!

PS - No flame wars, please, over the FLAC format vs. MP3.  I've made the links available, so if you prefer FLAC, just go ahead and get it instead.
