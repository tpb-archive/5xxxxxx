BBC Radio 4 presents dramatisations of all eight of John le CarrÃ©'s George Smiley novels, 
with Simon Russell Beale playing George Smiley throughout. 
â€œSimon Russell Beale is unique. No living actor can match his understanding of language, or his interpretation of character. He will make a superb Smiley, and I feel deeply honoured.â€John le CarrÃ© 


Jeremy Howe, Radio 4's Commissioning Editor for Drama, says, "For me The Complete Smiley is the most ambitious drama we have embarked upon in my time at Radio 4. Smiley is one of the great characters of 20th century fiction and the way he threads, weaves, ducks and dives his way through the complexities of the Cold War has given us some of the century's most enthralling stories. Be prepared to spend a lot of your Saturday and Sunday afternoons glued to the radio."

Recruited into the "Circus" in the late 1920s, when he might so easily have become an Oxford don, George Smiley spends the 1930s and early 1940s working undercover in Nazi Germany in daily fear of betrayal and death.

Recalled in 1943, he marries - to general astonishment - the beautiful but eternally unfaithful Lady Ann Sercomb.

With the end of the war, he returns to Oxford for a life of scholarly contemplation among the lesser German poets.

But rising tension between Soviet Russia and the West draw him back to the Circus as a Cold War warrior.
