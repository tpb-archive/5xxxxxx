Revo Uninstaller Pro 2.2.3/ Revo Uninstaller

Uninstall, delete, remove programs and solve uninstalling problems.
Revo Uninstaller helps you to uninstall and remove unwanted programs installed on your computer 
even if you have problems uninstalling and cannot uninstall them from "Windows Add or Remove Programs" 
control panel applet. Revo Uninstaller is a much faster and more powerful alternative 
to "Windows Add or Remove Programs" applet!
With its advanced and fast algorithm, Revo Uninstaller analyzes an application's data before uninstall 
and scans after you uninstall an application. After the program's regular uninstaller runs, 
you can remove additional unnecessary files, folders and registry keys that are usually left 
over on your computer. Even if you have a broken installation, Revo Uninstaller scans for an 
application's data on your hard disk drives and in the Windows registry and shows all found files, 
folders and registry keys so you can delete them. 

With its unique "Hunter mode", Revo Uninstaller offers you some simple, easy to use, but effective 
and powerful approaches to manage (uninstall, stop, delete, disable from auto starting) and to get 
information about your installed and/or running programs.
