Did you know your ISP might be providing you with less than the optimal online experience?

Even among technology enthusiasts, and information technology professionals the DOCSIS cable modem standard which governs how a cable broadband system operates is widely misunderstood. In some cases this lack of understanding can even be seen in cable systems in the form of widespread slowdowns and security holes. To make matters worse manufacturers of consumer cable equipment have completely locked down these devices often times making it impossible for users to diagnose their own problems. Theoryshare is a website dedicated to the understanding of these systems so that our users can enjoy the optimal broadband experience. One of the most important ways that our users can understand the DOCSIS standard, diagnose problems with their connection, and take control of their equipment is through the use of a diagnostic cable modem also known as a premod cable modem by some others. Download this free kit and learn how to convert your cable modem, into a diagnostic powerhouse. Common models such as the SB4100, SB4200, SB5100, SB5101, SB6120, DCM315, DCM425, and DPC2100 are supported. So download this totally free kit or visitto unleash the optimal broadband experience.
