Were you intrigued, but disappointed by The Bible Code?
Labuschagne's book is not the work of an amateur, but was written by one of Europe's leading biblical scholars and deals with one of the most important recent discoveries in the field of biblical study, namely that the books of the Bible are numerical compositions. The biblical writings were not written in an off-hand manner, but were meticulously composed according to compositional techniques in which the counting of words plays a crucial role. It goes without saying that this discovery has far-reaching consequences for our views on the formation and the structure of the text of the Hebrew Bible and of the Greek text of the New Testament.
The author introduces the reader to the fascinating world of number symbolism in biblical times, he demonstrates how well-known symbolic numbers, such as 7 and 12, and especially the lesser known holy numbers 17 and 26, which represent the numerical value of the name YHWH, were used to give structure to the text and to deepen its contents.
Among other fascinating findings, this study confirms the medieval Jewish tradition that Holy Scripture consists of the name of God set in succession, or interwoven in the fabric of the text.
