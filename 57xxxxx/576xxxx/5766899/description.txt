                       Stardock WindowBlinds 7.1.273 + Patch



Release date: June 08, 2010


WindowBlinds is an one-of-a-kind utility that allows users to completely change 
the look and feel of Windows to however you want it to look like by applying 
a new skin. 

WindowBlinds allows you to completely customize your desktop look by changing the 
style of title buttons, bars and toolbars. You can change the look of buttons and 
check boxes by assigning them skins, or personalities, and you can assign buttons 
that will launch programs to toolbars. 

You can create your own skins, choose from the four that are included in the 
program, or download additional ones. There are thousands of different skins 
to choose from that are freely downloadable from the WindowBlinds website.
 
A WindowBlinds skin can change to look like an alternative operating system, 
favorite sports car brands, favorite sports team, or virtually anything else.
You can also choose to exclude certain programs from WindowBlinds if you don`t 
want to change their appearances. 

Applying visual styles: In addition to the shortcut to the WindowBlinds Advanced 
Config window in your Start menu, you can change WB visual styles and settings 
from either the Skins or Appearance tab in Display Properties. 

Set the skin to Windows Classic to not use a WB skin on startup (or use the 
options on the Skins tab or in the Advanced Config window). 

WindowBlinds has been designed and tested to be as compatible with with thousands 
of applications and pieces of hardware available. Its memory load is quite low 
(unless you are using complex skins with lots of animation) and any oddities with 
specific apps can generally be worked around quickly (see the Troubleshooting 
section of the online help file for more information).

With modern video cards, WindowBlinds can do this without reducing performance. 
WindowBlinds 7 adds the ability to have "blurred glass" window borders on XP which
allows artists to make skins that could make XP look virtually identical to Vista.

>>>When using TPB please read these important notes: 
****************************************************

01- AV software may warn about keygens, patches, cracks etc because of their 
    capabilities and signatures (generating codes, etc). Sometimes also they're 
    added to the virus/spyware database and will be detected as malware. If not 
    trusting keygens, patches, cracks etc don't use them.

02- To avoid AV software removing/blocking clean cracks etc: exclude the crack 
    or folder from being auto-protected & auto-scanned by the AV software.

03- If AV software removed a clean crack usually it can be restored 
    (if it's not in Quarantaine then look at History or something similar).

04- To avoid risks when using cracks also Sandboxie can be used to test them:
    http://www.sandboxie.com/
    http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4918844/Sandboxie_v3.38___Keys_[RH]

05- Before running .exe-files, keygens, patches, cracks etc always check first 
    if they can be unpacked. Often some thirth party added a virus to the 
    original file, repacked it, and uploaded it again.

06- Letting AV software software sending scan results to their companies 
    can cause keygens, patches, cracks etc being added to their virus-database.

07- Firewalls which are set to automatically decide for connections will allow 
    connections for lots of apps & MALWARE!. To avoid so firewalls should be set 
    to decide yourself which connection to allow or not.

08- Clicking on unknown links can coz malware being silently installed on a pc!

09- Usually (new) torrents with extreme many downloads & seeders in a short time 
    are very suspicious! Torrents with a SKULL-logo are trusted.

10- Some (frustrated) people use multiple accounts and post lots of FAKE comments 
    and/or files trying to spread confusion. Usually they NEVER seriously reply 
    on comments and don't have any torrent, or to look reliable just a few.

11- In general often there are more fake & negative comments than reliable & 
    positive comments.

12- In some countries uploading/downloading copyright-protected material is 
    forbidden, but showing some appreciation to reliable uploaders is not.

13- Posting FAKE comments & uploads on TPB can result in getting banned from TPB!

This torrent is scanned with:
1- Norton Internet Security 
2- Avira AntiVir Premium 
3- avast! Pro Antivirus
4- Kaspersky Antivirus

Also scanned with most well known antispyware. Reported malware detected 
by other anti-malware software probably are false positives!


<--------------------------------------------------------------------------------->


To the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users",

Nowadays a lot of TPB members abuse their TPB membership by intenionally posting 
fake comments & files. Their meaning is just to spread confusion and try to 
frustrate TPB and it's users. And less downloaders = less seeders = less 
downloadspeed etc etc. 

It's in the benefit of TPB and all reliable users to warn each other about people 
who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files. It's an easy answer against 
those who intenionally keep posting fake comments & files, which is a never 
ending issue. 

When reporting errors or false positives just keep in mind that what goes up for 
one does not always goes up for another. That's for both the working of an app 
and about false positives! Remember: whatever is said, say it constructive! 
Let's just try to help each other and TPB by thinking about what's said & posted. 
Things are all up to you, the "United Reliable The Pirate Bay Users"!


Enjoy The Pirate Bay
