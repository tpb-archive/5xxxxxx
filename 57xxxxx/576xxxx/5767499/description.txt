"HELP" is a supernatural horror thriller which draws upon the story of a 
malevolent spirit that refuses to leave the human world and is out to exact 
retribution for past crimes committed against it. Protagonist Vic (Bobby Deol) 
is a successful horror film director in Bollywood and is married to Pia (Mugdha Godse).
 Pia and Vic are going through a difficult time in their marriage and in the midst 
of these troubled times they have to suddenly rush to Mauritius to take care of 
Pia's ailing father. On landing in Mauritius and going back to Pia's old family 
home Pia is confronted by her distant past which she has not had to face since 
she left Mauritius as a young 5 year old. Little do they know that there's 
something in this house. Something ancient and dark that remains hidden and 
silent. It can only wait, having been concealed in the shadows for years, 
poised to strike again. When Pia finds out that she is pregnant this darkly 
vicious spirit possesses Pia and starts to brutally kill the people close 
to her. As the darkness spreads, things start to get worse and the spirit tries 
to annihilate everything and everyone that comes in its way. Now Vic must race 
against time to save his pregnant wife, who seems to be possessed by the spirit 
of her twin sister Dia who died when they were both 5 years old. With the help 
of a renowned parapsychologist, Dr. Aditya Motwani, Vic has only 36 hours to 
discover the dark and terrifying truth behind Pia's family history of murderous 
madness and break the curse that has been put on them by a third mysterious other. 
Will Vic's love gather the strength to survive the paranormal with Aditya on his .
side or will they witness the most horrifying truth of their lives.
