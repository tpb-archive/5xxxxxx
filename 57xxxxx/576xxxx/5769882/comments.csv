Steam games like this are just installed files off of steam they won't get you banned. Only way get banned from steam play online with it.

After you install it you should be able close steam and run game without steam in background.. I been play steam games like this for years and still have my account

,lawlzilla,2010-08-24T00:09Z,Works great
,vellosch,2010-08-24T01:44Z,"Works fine! Good Job.

In Windows 7 64-bit lanch steambackup.exe in Administrator mode.
(choose Program Files)

After the installation overwrite the .exe and .dll with the crack.

If you want change language (Eng-Fre-Ger-Ita-Spa) modify language.txt in the directory.

IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEME WITH openal32.dll GO TO C:\[Installfolder]\Kane & Lynch 2- Dog Days\redist\openal 
and install oalinst.exe

3) Double Click ""STEAMBACKUP"" 
4) A box will come up prompting you to select WHICH FOLDER U WANT THE GAME INSTALLED TO... Mine is ""C:\Program Files (x86)""
5) Simply navigate through C: folder and find where you want to put it, then Click OK
6) Then just following the crack instructions, copy over the proper shit, and then make yourself a sandwich cause its been a tough day for you.
