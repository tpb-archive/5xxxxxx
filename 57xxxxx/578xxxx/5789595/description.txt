In the year of 2039, after World Wars destroy much of civilization as we know it, territories are no longer run by governments, but by corporations; the mightiest of which is the Tekken Corporation, which controls North America. In order to placate the seething masses of this dystopia, the corporation's Chairman/CEO, Heihachi Mishima, sponsors the King of Iron Fist Tournament, or Iron Fist - in which fighters battle until one is left standing, who in turn will receive a lifetime of stardom and wealth.

Jin Kazama, a rebellious teenage street fighter and contraband runner, witnesses the death of his mother, Jun, during Tekken's crackdown on insurgents in Tekken City's slum area referred to as the Anvil. In the ruins of his former home, he finds a Tekken Fighter I.D. among his late mother's belongings. Intrigued, as his mother was a staunch anti-Tekken activist who warned him to stay away from the tournament, he sets off to the Open Call, which allow the masses in the Anvil to pick a fighter for the tournament. After defeating the disgraced fighter Marshall Law, Jin gains sponsorship from former boxer Steve Fox and is hailed by the masses as "The People's Choice".

Upon entering the heart of Tekken City, Jin meets and befriends mixed martial artist Christie Monteiro. Jin wins his first match against Miguel Caballero Rojo, nearly killing him in a fit of rage. Later that night, after sneaking out with Christie and visiting a nightclub where they flirt and bond, Jin is attacked by the assassin sisters Anna and Nina Williams (who are also taking part in the tournament, both fighting for one of Tekken's rival corporation, Eyderdex), who are acting on the orders of Kazuya Mishima, son of Heihachi. Kazuya also schemes to overtake Tekken Corp from his father. Jin survives the assassination attempt, thanks to Christie's interference. Steve and Christie both attempt to dissuade Jin from continuing in the tournament, as his life is in danger. Against their wishes, Jin vows to win Iron Fist and kill Heihachi. Meanwhile, Kazuya blackmails the martial artist Bryan Fury into killing Jin in a match or be exposed as a cyborg, effectively banning him from the tournament for life.

During the quarter-finals, Jin is matched up against the mysterious swordsman Yoshimitsu. Heihachi, taking a shine to this young fighter, deems that this match be reserved for the semi-finals and attempts to change the order. He is stopped by Kazuya, who has gained control of the Jackhammers, or Jacks (high tech soldiers used for peacekeeping and insurgent destruction). Kazuya then has Heihachi imprisoned and orders the match to begin, effectively seizing control of Tekken. Jin narrowly defeats Yoshimitsu, thanks to Heihachi tripping a security alert in the arena. Following the match, Kazuya orders all of the fighters to be detained. He later tells the imprisoned fighters that the rules have changed, wherein they must fight to the death in order to advance. Along with Raven and Heihachi, Jin, Christie, and Steve launch an escape. Raven is wounded and recaptured, but the rest make it out to the Anvil.

When the fighters find a hideout, Heihachi reveals to Jin the true nature of his origin, explaining that many years ago, Kazuya raped Jun and attempted to kill her. He took her out of Tekken City to keep her alive. Heihachi also states that now Jin can become the next chairman of Tekken Corp and that its true purpose was to restore order to the chaos-ridden world and help the people rise again, much to Jin's disagreement and distrust. Heihachi entrusts Jin to defeat Kazuya, but soon after, the hideout is located by Jacks who engage in a quick firefight that results in the death of Steve, and the recapture of the rest. Before taking Jin and Christie back to Iron Fist, Kazuya orders Jacks to execute Heihachi.

Back into the tournament, a bruised Jin is forced to fight against Bryan in the finals while Kazuya holds Christie captive in the control room. After a bloody struggle, Jin triumphs, killing the cyborg. Angered, Kazuya orders a new final contestant for Jin: himself. He walks down to the arena, two half moon axes in hand, and begins the final match. The weaponless Jin is battered, but is saved when Christie escapes, shooting the Jacks guarding her and creating a distraction. This allows Jin to wound and pin down Kazuya to the ground. Kazuya taunts him into inheriting the Mishima Curse (Heihachi imprisoned and killed his father and Kazuya murdered Heihachi), but Jin stops from killing his father, stating that he is a Kazama, not a Mishima. Christie comes down to the stage and declares Jin the new Iron Fist Champion. Elated, the Crowd both in and outside the arena cheer for him. When Christie asks where he will go, he replies that he will go back home to the Anvil. He walks out of Tekken City's gate and, in a scene reminiscent of Tekken 5, he is saluted by the Jacks - symbolizing his role as the new CEO of Tekken Corp. Jin walks the streets of the Anvil, a crowd follows him. A voiceover from Christie explains that Jin's victory made his name synonymous with hope amongst his people in the Anvil, but that the true legacy of Tekken is only beginning.

In a post-credits scene, a wounded Kazuya walks by the holding cells back at the arena, as the scene shifts back to Heihachi's execution. A Jack has Heihachi kneel at gunpoint. His final words are: "I am Mishima Heihachi. I...am...Tekken. You WILL obey." The Jack lowers its gun in a sign of obedience, as Heihachi looks on, ready to take back his empire
