,Dasos,2010-08-27T00:07Z,"Okay, would anyone be kind enough to write out a full installation instruction for this game? I got as far as unpacking the Rar's which gave me a .bin file (346MB) and a .cue file (599bytes). From here I don't really know what to do with them.
 With poweriso I managed to convert them into .daa files I think, but after mounting you double click the virtual drive and it just takes you inside and shows you the .bin file, as opposed to an autoplay type reaction with splash screen etc.
 I feel like I'm pretty close, has anyone got any advice? Greatly appreciated ^_^"
,Dasos,2010-08-27T00:12Z,"LOL. lololol.
 My bad sorry guys, all you have to do is use deamontools to mount the .cue file.
 Silly me /doh!"
,Reaper24,2010-08-27T02:08Z,"All you have to do is mount either the .cue file or the .bin one (doesn't matter which) and then install the game. Once done, crack your game. If you don't know how, read the instructions."

Many LEGIT buyers of this game are reporting up a storm about loading issues, crashes, and other bugs on the STEAM forum.  SO in other words, this is why we try before we buy folks.  If it don't work, MOVE THE FUCK ON and stop asking people nub ass questions.  If you can't fucking figure how to install and run these games you are pirating you don't deserve to be here."

download the dll file from here. extract it then copy it and paste it in system32 folder (dont worry its safe!) and in the folder or root directory of the game.

@Vr3im
Just extract the first file (.00)and the rest all will extract by themselve to for a single file.
 Then mount it and go search for a video if you dont know how to mount !

,palhinha,2010-10-22T09:49Z,"Try this it workss for me and i have win vista 64

Potential workarounds:
If you have a soundblaster card then disable it and try and run sound either through another soundcard or motherboard integrated sound.
Create a new file in the worms folder named Local.cfg . Create this file within notepad and then just save it as that name. The file should just contain the following ""/nosound"".
Verify the game cache, there may have been an issue with your download. Doing this will check for errors and redownload any files that are corrupt or missing.
If running spyware doctor disable it"
,thebigmbg,2010-10-23T20:38Z,"will it run on INTEL 1.8GHz, RAM512, nVIDIA MX 440 64MB. PLEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAZEEEEEE HEEEELLLLP"
[T],Distrance,2010-10-24T23:02Z,"To those wondering : There wont be a crack for multiplayer because it is a STEAM GAME. You can't play those online as they need verification from the Steam servers and that ain't happening.

Your best bet is to use Tunngle or Hamachi to set up Virtual LAN"

because your internet sucks. i got this downloaded in 1 min."
,coldutd24,2010-11-17T07:19Z,"To those that have problems getting the game to start:
I found that the crack provided here didn't work. Kept getting a MSDos copy error. Instead, download this crack: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5811943/Worms_Reloaded_SKIDROW_(Crack_Only)
After that, just copy and paste all the individual crack files into your program folder.

To those having no sound during gameplay:
Download and update DirectX - http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/confirmation.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=2da43d38-db71-4c1b-bc6a-9b6652cd92a3

,NakedKitten,2011-12-18T17:25Z,"To everyone who is getting problems Steam related trying to run the game, in order to play it, you must exit Steam.

Any Non-Steam game that there is will pretty much make you have to exit it in order to play the game. This goes with Worms, Counter Strike, Half Life, and any other game that is available on Steam.

And no, you won't be able to connect to most servers because they are Steam registered server, which in order to join, you would have to buy the whole game..."

,arvokm,2012-02-23T17:43Z,"hello, I downloaded the package, and got only .bin files (no .iso) what should a noob like me do?"
,Fedorov,2012-04-12T00:22Z,"Yeah... for fixing the sound download the new Directx driver. And to all the people saying that you can't move you worm in level 3 - YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED to move your worm in that level, that's the whole point! 

But it does seem that there are bugs in the game. So I am downloading patch 18 for it. 

And basically it is the same thing as Worms Armageddon, actually all worms games are more or less the same game. I was hoping for better graphics or a much better single player campaign."
,snailien,2012-07-02T04:08Z,"ran it with steam, claims it needs to be running. steam then just prompts me to purchase it...read a comment saying run it withoput steam and when i do that it just loads steam...stupid, stupid stupid.  "
