standard interface for controlling all of your simulation
tools. SynaptiCAD's timing diagram editors have the most
extensive and accurate timing analysis features available

correlation, reconvergent fan-out, and clocks that model
jitter and buffer delays. Three different levels of editing

application.  Free yourself from the time-consuming process
of manually writing Verilog, VHDL, and SystemC testbenches.
Generate them graphically from timing diagrams.SynaptiCAD
provides 3 levels of test bench generation to meet all your
design needs. SynaptiCAD offers support for the latest test
equipment and emulation technologies allowing you to port
