When some very creepy things start happening around school, the kids at Herrington High make a chilling discovery that confirms their worst suspicions: their teachers really are from another planet! As mind-controlling parasites rapidly begin spreading from the faculty to the student's bodies, it's ultimately up to the few who are left...an unlikely collection of loners, leaders, nerds and jocks...to save the world from alien domination.
