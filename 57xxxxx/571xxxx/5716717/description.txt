Plot:

David Allen Griffin is a cool killer- time and time again, he chooses a
female victim, studies her for weeks till he knows her routine to the
smallest detail, makes meticulous preparations using his forensic knowledge
to gain entry when she's quite alone, subdues her and administers a long,
torturous death. Joel Campbell got so frustrated by his failure to capture
Griffin in LA that he quit the FBI, moved to Chicago and remains in
psychiatric therapy, unable to function normally. Then he realizes, when
opening his mail very late, that a new murder victim is Griffin's, and the
killer send him pictures of her. Campbell reports this to the police, but
is unwilling to join them in the search, suggesting Griffin is too slick
and clever; yet he won't get out of it that easily,
