* Added new GRLDR 0.94 from zsmin

Version 1.6.8

/silent
 Turns on silent mode

/restart
 Restart the OS after install (used with /silent)

/norestart
 Prevents system restart after successful installation

/preactivate
 This just helps the loader decide on it's environment

/bios
 Force the application to install just the certificate and serial

/loader
 Force the application to install the loader

/swap
 Install the loader without changing your systems boot code

/k=XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX
 Set the Windows 7/2008/Vista key

/c=
 Set the certificate (use the name of a certificate from the certificates folder or from the SLIC list)

/s=
 Set the SLIC (Acer, Advent, Alienware, Asus, BenQ, Casper, Dell, Exper, Founder, FSC, Fujitsu, Gigabyte, Haier, Hasee, HCL, HP, Jooyon, Lenovo, LG, Medion, MSI, NEC, Nokia, Quanmax, Samsung, Sony, Tongfang, Toshiba, Trigem, Viliv, Wartmann)

======
* If you don't set the certificate it will default to your BIOS's model
* If you don't set the SLIC it will default to your BIOS's model
* If you don't set the key it will default to your BIOS's model and the correct one for the OS (Ultimate, Professional, Starter or Home Premium)
* You can use these arguments via SetupComplete.cmd to pre-activate Windows 7/Vista/Server 2008
======

Example:
"D:Windows Loader.exe" /silent /restart /k=342DG-6YJR8-X92GV-V7DCV-P4K27 /c=Acer /s=Acer


SetupComplete.cmd Example:

@ECHO OFF
%~dp0"Windows Loader.exe" /silent /preactivate
cd %~dp0
attrib -R -A -S -H *.*
SHUTDOWN /R /T 5
RMDIR /S /Q "%WINDIR%SetupScripts"

If a certificate or SLIC is released and I have not put out a new version of my application
simply create two folders, one called "Certificates" and another called "SLICs".

In each folder put the files you want to add support for, just be sure you label the files
like this:

*Certificates folder*
Acer.XRM-MS
Advent.XRM-MS
Alienware.XRM-MS
Asus.XRM-MS


*SLICs folder*
Acer.BIN
Advent.BIN
Alienware.BIN
Asus.BIN


When using external files all preset internals will be ignored, this is a cleaner approach
for users who want to build their own list without my presets getting in the way.
