- Bass solos

In a career filled with strange albums, "Psychic Existentialism" might just be the strangest -- yet most strangely MUSICAL -- album that Scissor Shock has made! Contradictory and hard to pin down as ever, the sound on this album jumps from some of the most frighteningly complex bedroom compositions this world has ever heard, to creeping jazz ambience, to tribal noise excursions, to tape loop hilarity, and back -- all without ever being predictable in the least, and even sometimes being kind of, you know, fun.

This album was the result of many months -- sometimes years! (one song took over two years to write and arrange) -- of preparation, which made for a fairly smooth recording process. Hundreds of little layers of microsounds are arranged in very specific and bizarre ways.  

This is one complex album, but it's also got some genuinely fun moments; strange progressive half-riffs, long Beefheart-ian marimba/xylaphone/guitar single-note interplay, horns announcing the second coming of the devil, telephone vocals ranting about God knows what.  

Lies:
Pitchforkmedia gave this a 10.0 and said it's the most important album since Kid A. Rolling Stone gave it 5 stars (out of 4).  Every single person on last.fm is scrobbling it at this very second. Every user on rateyourmusic is putting it on every list ever made, good and bad.  Don Van Vliet came out of retirement just to issue a statement that Captain Beefheart might be the greatest band ever but Scissor Shock is a "close 2nd".  Actors Nicolas Cage, Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken and actress Ellen Page, Sasha Grey (who is genuinely a fan of this band -- not a lie!) has agreed to appear in the movie version of this album.
