"Desperado" is a song by the Eagles, written by Glenn Frey and Don Henley. It first appeared on the 1973 album Desperado, and has later appeared on numerous compilation albums.

Don Henley stated in the notes written in the booklet to Eagles' 2003 "The Very Best Of" compilation, that "Desperado" was a piece of a song that he had written in 1968. He said, "It was called something else, but it was the same melody, same chords. I think it had something to do with Astrology [chuckles]."

While this is one of the Eagles' signature songs, it was never released as a single. "Desperado" was voted #494 in the Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

Desperado is the second album by the American rock band Eagles. It was recorded at Island Studios in London, United Kingdom and released in 1973. It's a concept album, based on the Dalton gang and the Old West.

Although the title track is one of the Eagles' signature songs, it was never released as a single. The album did yield two singles, though: "Tequila Sunrise" and "Outlaw Man".

This album was slated for Quadraphonic release and even given a Quadraphonic catalog number, but never released in the format.

The Eagles are an American rock band formed in Los Angeles, California in 1971 by Glenn Frey, Don Henley, Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner.

With five number one singles and six number one albums, the Eagles were one of the most successful recording artists of the 1970s. At the end of the 20th century, two of their albums, Their Greatest Hits (1971â€“1975) and Hotel California, ranked among the 20 best-selling albums in the U.S. according to the Recording Industry Association of America. Hotel California is ranked 37th in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and the band was ranked #75 on the magazine's 2004 list of the 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. They also have the best selling album in the U.S. with Their Greatest Hits (1971â€“1975), which sold more than 29 million copies.

The Eagles broke up in July 1980, but reunited in 1994 for Hell Freezes Over, a mix of live and new studio tracks. They have toured intermittently since then, and were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2007, Eagles released Long Road out of Eden, their first full studio album in 28 years. The next year they launched The Long Road out of Eden Tour in support of the album. The tour continued on into 2009, crossing North America and Europe, and will continue in 2010 with additional North American, as well as Australian, tour dates.
