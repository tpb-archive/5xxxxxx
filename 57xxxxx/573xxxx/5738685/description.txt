(x3) 
I'm stuttering, oh oh oh oh oh. 

I can't believe it babe, you got me disarrayed. 
I stand up, end up, its like I'm stuck in place. 
I go to speak my mind, forgetting what to say. 
You're the only one who makes me feel this way. 
So at the most, baby we might play the silent game, catch each other's eye again. 
But that's where it ends. 
Until you ask me my name and I feel like a kid again. 
Its that feelin', I need again 
But I'm so gone. 

I don't even know if I can even be me. 
Cause it's so hard to be me when you're next to me. 
If I could say so, I'd say what I'm feeling. 
But I can say so, my lips just tremble. 
I'm stuttering, oh oh oh oh oh. 
I'm stuttering, oh oh oh oh oh. 
I'm stuttering, oh oh oh oh oh. 
What's happening to me, I keep stuttering. 

I wanna conversate, tell you how I see your face. 
Its so me, it's lovely, that's exactly what I'd say. 
But I'm running out of time cause my words are fumbling. 
Theres no way I could turn and walk away. 
So at the most, baby we might play the silent game, catch each other's eye again. 
But that's where it ends. 
Until you ask me my name and I feel like a kid again. 
Its that feelin', I need again 
But I'm so gone. 

I don't even know if I can even be me. 
Cause it's so hard to be me when you're next to me. 
If I could say so, I'd say what I'm feeling. 
But I can say so, my lips just tremble. 
I'm stuttering, oh oh oh oh oh. 
I'm stuttering, oh oh oh oh oh. (Don't you hear me stuttering) 
I'm stuttering, oh oh oh oh oh. 
What's happening to me, I keep stuttering. 

And I know what I need is to say what I need. 
And possibly this could be one of my dreams (Yeah yeah baby) 

(x2) 
I don't even know if I can even be me. 
Cause it's so hard to be me when you're next to me. 
If I could say so, I'd say what I'm feeling. 
But I can say so, my lips just tremble. 
I'm stuttering, oh oh oh oh oh. 
I'm stuttering, oh oh oh oh oh. 
I'm stuttering, oh oh oh oh oh. 
What's happening to me, I keep stuttering.
