LYRICS 

\"Get Outta My Way\"

What\'s the worst thing that could happen to you?
Take a chance tonight and try something new.
You\'re getting boring.
You\'re all so boring, and I don\'t recognize the zombie you\'re turning \'to.
Don\'t worry cause tonight I got you.
You can take a seat, do what you normally do.
I\'m about to let you see.
This is what\'ll happen if you ain\'t giving your girl what she needs.

Leave you, move on
To a perfect stranger
You talk I walk
Wanna feel the danger
See me with him and it\'s turnin\' you on
Got me saying getting me back it\'d be another song

Get outta my way
Got no more to say
He\'s takin\' your place
Get outta my way
Way outta my way
Got no more to say
He\'s takin\' your place
Get outta my way

Now I got a taste I wanna explore.
Ain\'t going to waste, no not anymore.
You\'re going hard now, to win my heart but.
So many times now, you\'ve been comin\' up short.
Don\'t worry cause tonight I got you.
You can take a seat do what you normally do.
I\'m about to let you see.
This is what\'ll happen if you ain\'t giving your girl what she needs.

[Chorus]
Leave you, move on
To a perfect stranger
You talk I walk
Wanna feel the danger
See me with him and it\'s turnin\' you on
Got me saying getting me back it\'d be another song

Get outta my way
Got no more to say
He\'s takin\' your place
Get outta my way
Way outta my way
Got no more to say
He\'s takin\' your place
Get outta my way

No I ain\'t going home cause I wanna stay, but I won\'t be alone no how no way.
Now I\'ve showed you what I\'m made of.
This is what\'ll happen if you ain\'t giving your girl what she needs.

[Chorus]
Leave you, move on
To a perfect stranger
You talk I walk
Wanna feel the danger
See me with him and it\'s turnin\' you on
Got me saying getting me back it\'d be another song

Get outta my way
Got no more to say
He\'s takin\' your place
Get outta my way
Way outta my way
Got no more to say
He\'s takin\' your place
Get outta my way
