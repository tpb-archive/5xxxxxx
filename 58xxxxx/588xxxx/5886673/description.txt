This is the second stable release of the new Unicode version of mIRC and addresses a number of issues that have been reported by users since the last release. It includes improvements, changes and fixes to a number of features, including:

* A new and improved Log Files dialog has been added that allows you to search log files and to view them in a window in mIRC.

* A Clear History dialog has been added to the Tools menu that allows you to clear the history of a number of features.

* File transfers now display progress bars in different colors to indicate transfer status.

* DCC Send transfer speed has been improved.

* A "UTF-8 encode/decode messages" option has been added to the Messages dialog to enable or disable UTF-8 encoding/decoding of server messages.

* The DNS routines have been changed to only request IPv6 if you are using features that require it, which should speed up connections for some users.

* Many other changes and bug fixes
