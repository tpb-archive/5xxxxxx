Release Notes:

A Zo Mode production for the video game charity initiative
OneBigGame, Chime pits gamers against the melody in an all-new puzzle
experience. Place blocks against the clock, complete solid quads and
try to cover the whole playing surface, all the while remixing and
embellishing pieces by musicians from across the planet. And you get
to feel good about yourself, too: The console version of Chime was
originally developed for OneBigGame with all the developer s royalties
going to Charity for sales up to June 2010, and Zoe Mode will continue
to donate a proportion of its royalties (equivalent to 5% of purchase
price) for sales of the Steam version. OneBigGame always aims to
donate a minimum of 80% of all donations to its charity partners Save
the Children and the Starlight Children's foundation

Puzzle: Rotate and place shapes to form solid quads and fill up the
grid before the time runs out

Listen: Chime features music by Moby, Paul Hartnoll (Orbital), and more
Remix: Fill the grid to alter the track loop, place pieces to play
notes, and create quads to trigger a range of song samples

Replay: Reset the grid by reaching 100% and continue playing and beat
your high score

Experience: Each of the six unique levels is made up of its own music
grid, and shape sets, including the new Portal-inspired sixth level:
"Still Alive"

Free-play mode: Choose between three different levels of difficulty or
just play for the sake of making music with no time pressure

RIPPED: Nothing
