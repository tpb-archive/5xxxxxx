The cult BBC comedy show sends-up the world of celebrity like no other! Come and join the illustrious residents of Stella Street including Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Jack Nicholson, Michael Caine, Jimmy Hill, Joe Pesci, Al Pacino, David Bowie and Madonna amongst others!

Two guys playing whole street of characters.... Holly wood characters such as Jack Nicholson and Al Pacino living in the leafy suburbs of Surbiton. It's all pure genius, from the corner shop run by Jagger and Richards, to the running commentary by Michael Caine. In the middle of it all is Jimmy Hill, pleading with for someone to watch the FA cup final with him. This is classic off the wall BBC2 comedy. Well worth a watch. Classic genius.

I've run this Region 2 DVD through http://www.dvddecrypter.org.uk/ so it's now a region free and unaltered original DVD.

If this UPload goes well and I get some support from other seeders to free up my bandwidth I will UP -
Stella Street Series 3 complete DVD,
Stella Street Movie 2004 DVD.

This is a really funny cult comedy, and can't see it on any torrent sites anywhere, with Stella Street 2004 (DVD Rip) being the last upload (back in 2005) which has now long since died. I tried to Rip this to AVI but in the end felt it best to keep it in it's original DVD form.

Thanks to the seeders of Stella Street Series 1.You rock.
