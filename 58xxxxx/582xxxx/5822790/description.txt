in charge of an item shop built into her house, in order to pay back a
loan her father took and then skipped out on - and Tear, her newfound
fairy "companion", won't take no for an answer As Recette, you have to
decide how you'll get your stock - either through playing the markets in
town or going out into the wild with an adventuring friend and thrashing
beasts until they give up the goodies - how much to sell things for, what
