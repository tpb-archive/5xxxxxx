I'm gonna KISS you if you help me here.

My xp sp2 32-bit system doesn't work well on my new computer, so i decided to download a x64 operating system.

And here's my configuration:
ASRock P45DE3 motherboard,
4 GB of RAM,
nWidia GeForce GTS250 graphical card,
Intel Core, Quad processor, 2.33GHz.

And now, to turn on the W7 you gave here.
I set up the system PERFECTLY, and i could word for days on it. But, as soon as I install ''AirLive'', and set up my wireless network, go to some browser, THE SYSTEM FREEZE'S.

,Iwannabefamous,2010-11-23T19:36Z,"Thx for upload.
Got some probs.
I've burned the .iso to a dvd. Tryed put it into the computer and started the program.
A message poped up and said:

This version isn't compatible with your version of windows. To upgrade, u need the correct installation disc. For more information check you computers's system information. To install a new version of windows, restart (boot) your computer using the installation disc and then chose custom (advanced).

Whats the problem?"
,SmegMaster,2010-11-23T23:12Z,"Thanks for the awesome torrent Computer-User! works perfect :D

@Iwannabefamous   Are you 100% sure that your CPU supports 64-bit?  

To find out if your processor is 64-bit-capable, do the following:

   1.

      Open Performance Information and Tools by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Performance Information and Tools.
   2.

      Click View and print details.
   3.

      In the System section, you can see what type of operating system you're currently running under System type. Under 64-bit capable, you can see whether you can run a 64-bit version of Windows. (If your computer is already running a 64-bit version of Windows, you won't see the 64-bit capable listing.)

[T],fabunbutaps,2010-11-24T00:47Z,"Thank o lot for this torrent no viruses no files missing!!!

exactly what i want

Big thank from Rangiroa-french polynesia!!!

SEE YA!!!"
,Iwannabefamous,2010-11-24T10:17Z,"I have checked now, and my computer is 64-bit capable...
So thats not the prob.
Damn I really have to find whats wrong coz i really need windows 7 now :)
Btw im running windows vista 32-bit now."
,SmegMaster,2010-11-25T20:47Z,@Iwannabefamous Yeah i had some problems with burning it also so i did this: http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-create-bootable-windows-7-usb-to-install-windows-7-from-usb-flash-drive-using-windows-7-dvdusb-tool/ Its very easy to use but you need a usb flash drive with atleast 4 gigabytes on it. I myelf did not have one so i ran to my local store and bought one for 10 euros. And when you have the windows on it just restart your pc. (make sure that the usb drive is in yer pc) Then go to the boot menu by pressing F8 repeatedly (if you press it only once its not surely going to the boot menu) when its showing the motherboard screen and select the usb drive from the boot menu. Then the install should start. Remember to backup all the files you want to keep!

,SmegMaster,2010-11-26T15:19Z,No thank YOU for the great torrent! :D But it could be that iwannabefamous is having the same problem that i did because i couldnt install it either from an dvd and he said that he checked that his windows is 64-bit compatible and he was trying it straight from windows (i assume) and if youre changin bits it doesnt go that way... He should try the usb flash drive install. Worked like a charm for me.

I was able to get windows updates and downloads from the microsoft site and pass the genuine windows shit. 

Will this torrent be the same in microsoft thinking it is genuine, letting me get updates ect?

Thanks again"

Yes You Will Be Able To Receive Windows Updates From Microsoft :)

You DO NOT Need A Product Key, But After Windows Installation Is Complete Just Use The Included Activation Program :)

I downloaded this version (September 2010) because of the ""simplicity"" of the instruction and very few files. Install then activate only.

I know that we must avoid 971033. But I just learned today that Windows 7 SP1 can detect non-genuine versions.

Have you find a round about on this? Do I have to avoid SP1 too?
