From failed attempts and past dreams, a new spark is ignited!
What started out as an idea from three friends in early 2000 quickly became a local craze earlier this year when
guitarist Elijah Carr made the call to finally start what had been a nagging thought put off for a decade.
Asleigh Stake, a five piece metal band from Flowery Branch, Georgia that draws inspiration from all walks of life.
Combine strong music knowledge with unrelenting waves of sonic ferocity.
This band has what it takes, to rise above the standard and establish themselves as a dominant figure in the metal world.
"While some aim for material gain, friendships or laughs. Asleigh Stake is a means of being real with oneself, ascending past genre limitations."
These five individuals bring a little more to the table when it comes to creating.
Not even a show under their belts and with a highly anticipated fall LP release, this band is without a doubt one of the most sought-after acts of 2010. Stay tuned for what these young adults have to offer in the coming days.
