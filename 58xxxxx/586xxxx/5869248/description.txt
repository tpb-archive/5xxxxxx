Ecco The Tides of Time
SEGA Genesis Classics

The Vortex, the nearly invincible, secret, yet supremely dangerous
enemy, now seems so far away.

Its only been a short time since this monster tore Eccos family from
Home Bay. Then Ecco braved the unknown waters to find and defeat this
menace that fed on the creatures of the sea.

The Vortex Queen, though weakened, was not destroyed. She followed
Ecco from her hive in deep space back to this new, nourishing planet.
Now, plunging into the warm waters of Earth, she seeks out a deep
chasm and sinks into the abyss, where she feeds upon the Earth as she
spawns streams of Vortex young.

Her feeding builds in strength, creating a downward current against
which small fish struggle in vain. She is creating a new Vortex race,
and her presence on Earth bodes doom for all its creatures

Ecco must rid the world of this engulfing evil. Even as he tumbles in
the waves, the future is unfolding. But must it be a dark future ruled
by the Vortex and  lifeless, miserable and cold? Does Earth stand a
chance?

Ecco must stop the Vortex He is the stone that splits the stream of
time. He now faces his most dangerous quest yet. For it is not just
his dolphin pod at stake, but the Earth and all living beings
