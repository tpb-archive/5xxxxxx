Judging from the number of downloads of NCIS and Las Vegas TV series that I've packaged into H.264 MP4's, there appears to be a large demand for these TV shows in a modern video container. AVI's have become obsolete. Good riddance. 

However, to support these and future downloads I ask YOU KEEP SEEDING after your download is complete. I suggest you set a minimum UL speed of 50 kB/s by right clicking on the torrent in your Bittorrent client and adjusting the Bandwidth Allocation. This will free up my bandwidth for new torrent uploads. THANKS!

I took DVD's of the TV show 24 and ripped H.264 MP4 files of each episode. The files have a suffix of .m4v as they were ripped using HandBrake 0.9.4 with an Apple TV standard so they can be played on any current iPod, iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or in iTunes. They can also be played on any compliant player but you may need to change the suffix from .m4v to .mp4.

You may notice the file sizes differ widely from episode to episode.
HandBrake uses quality-based encoding. This means that instead of telling encoders to use a specific size and vary quality to meet it, we tell the encoder to vary size to meet a given quality level. Overall quality improves, since bits are spent only when they are needed, and are saved when they are not. While this means output size is somewhat unpredictable, the results in picture quality speak for themselves

Additional info:

Total bit rate: 1894 kbps
FPS: 29.97
Video Dimensions 849 x 480
Audio Channels: ACC and Stereo 48,000 kHz

There are no subtitles or alternate languages.

24 Season One takes place on the day of the presidential primary.
The season's main plot revolves around an assassination attempt on Maryland Senator David Palmer, a candidate for the presidential nomination, on the day of the California primary. 

The central character is Jack Bauer, a former Delta Force operator who is the Director of the fictional Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) in Los Angeles. Bauer becomes professionally as well as personally involved when his wife Teri and daughter Kim are kidnapped by the people behind the assassination plot.

The season is essentially divided into three acts:
The first act revolves around a mercenary group's efforts to control Jack Bauer and force him to kill Senator Palmer by kidnapping Bauer's wife and daughter. This culminates in Jack's successful rescue of his family.
In the second act, a second wave of assassins is discovered, as CTU tracks their activity, Jack learns why he and the Senator are being targeted.

The final act reveals the true mastermind of the day's events and he initiates his contingency plan to eliminate Jack and the Senator.
