The fan-favorite anti-hero from AVENGERS: INITIATIVE explodes into his own mini-

series! Taskmaster has trained hench-thugs for every terrorist organization and

 criminal cartel in the Marvel Universe. So when the rumor starts that he's turned 

traitor and now works for STEVE ROGERS, a billion-dollar bounty is put on his head, 

and every cadre of costumed fanatics -- A.I.M., Hydra, Ultimatum, the Sons of the 

Serpent, everyone -- looks to collect. Now Taskmaster has to fight hordes upon 

hordes of his psychopathic students while at the same time figuring out who framed 

him -- which requires him figuring out who he really is! That's right, the man with 

the photographic reflexes has no memory of his true identity -- and you'll learn 

the unexpected truth along with him! The action-packed SECRET ORIGIN of Taskmaster 

begins here!
