The Alex Jones Show
Sunday, 05 September 2010


[sebaygo1]


The 2 hour Sunday show is typically a review of the past week's news and a look forward to the coming week's events.


The Infowars web site describes today's show:

On this Sunday Edition, Alex talks [sic] the prospect of the neocon Republicans being swept into power in November, the attempt of Democrats to collectivize the nation, and Glenn Beck's novel The Overton Window and its comparison to Orwell's 1984. Alex also talks about the race war film Machete and takes your calls.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually essential 
 to seek information from a variety of sources, to listen to a
 spectrum of voices in order to better  understand the "big 
 picture." A reliance solely upon mainstream corporate media 
 for news and info is a prescription for ignorance. I try to
 share information that counters the monotone of mainstream
 corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
