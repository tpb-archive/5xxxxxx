On with the game release information:

Amnesia: The Dark Descent, a first person survival horror. A
game about immersion, discovery and living through a
nightmare. An experience that will chill you to the core.

Amnesia: The Dark Descent puts you in the shoes of Daniel as
he wakes up in a desolate castle, barely remembering anything
about his past. Exploring the eerie pathways, you must also
take part of Daniel's troubled memories. The horror does not
only come from the outside, but from the inside as well. A
disturbing odyssey into the dark corners of the human mind
awaits.

By using a fully physically simulated world, cutting edge 3D
graphics and a dynamic sound system, the game pulls no punches
when trying to immerse you. Once the game starts, you will be
in control from the beginning to the end. There are no
cut-scenes or time-jumps, whatever happens will happen to you
first hand.

Amnesia: The Dark Descent throws you headfirst into a
dangerous world where danger can lurk behind every corner.
Your only means of defense are hiding, running or using your
wits.

Do you have what it takes to survive?
