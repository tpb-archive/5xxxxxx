2nd: if its not on a flight1 wrapper, what is not functioning? so that people here can get an idea on HOW TO."
,wroomster,2011-02-04T10:41Z,"@airamerica

Do you remember PMDG...MD11 and 747, and all those ""bomb's"" inside, that erase all your textures from FS?
Ifly, have something like that, within installation. It will not erase your textures, but will do some random failure, like FMC random route deletion, flaps at 30 all by it selfe, rudder go left or right, no autopilot...
As i told, only WORKING CRACK is from interim patch 1.01, everything else like, interim patch 1.02, SP1 rev1, rev2, rev3...have those ""bomb's"" inside.
Wait for a WORKING CRACK, like we are waiting...if you don't want to wait, than buy it! "
,airamerica,2011-02-04T17:09Z,"@wroomster

Yeah I remember those bombs, nasty trick huh.. if only we could rip this thing! not install directly to FS."
,svedan832,2011-02-09T21:03Z,"Wroomster is right this aircraft is unflyable,
there are three major bugs/bombs on this CRACKED aircraft
* FMC route deletion happens every  ~5min while on the ground, not while airborne, so unless you are allready sitting on the runway and you are a very fast FMC programmer and already know  what waypoints,  sids/stars  that you be using you can avoid this problem. Its quite annoying to reprogram the route
* While on route the Autopilot randomly disengage, full deflection rudder to the right/left, trims the aircraft full up/down, setting flaps to 40 degrees. all these things happens at once, randomly while airborne, If you are taking a crap while this occurs you will probably have crashed by the time your back. You can still continue if you center rudder, set the trim to neutral, retract flaps and engage the autopilot. But itâ€™s very annoying though
*Freezes and electrical failure. This happens randomly while airborne. The primary flight display freezes so you no longer get airspeed, attitude and altitudeâ€¦., at same time all the lights extinguish the navigation map and EICAM still works though and the engines goes nuts, N1 goes up to 105% and turns red. I have not found any solution for this problem I have tried a lot with no results. You just have to restart flight simulator.
Some people are claiming that the autopilot wont engage, well thatâ€™s cause the aircraft has to be trimmed correctly, but I agree itâ€™s too petulant
As somebody said before me, version 1.01 is said to be more stable than having installed service pack 1. I have not tried running version 1.01 so I have no idea whether its working better or not.
