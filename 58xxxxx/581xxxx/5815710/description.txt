Linda Smith's A Brief History of Timewasting was a short-lived BBC Radio 4 situation comedy series written by and starring the late Linda Smith. It ran for two series (of six episodes each) from July 2001 until July 2002.

Set in East London, where Smith herself lived, A Brief History of Timewasting concerned the struggle of a single woman to fill the day, helped by her inept, sugar-loving, live-in builder Chris (Chris Neill), morbid elderly neighbour Betty (Margaret John), and Cab driver Worra (Femi Olufowuju Junior). Supporting roles were played by Jeremy Hardy and Martin Hyder.

Smith's playing to her audience led to many familiar voices from Radio 4, including then-chief announcer Peter Donaldson, Thought for the Day regular Rabbi Lionel Blue, and Woman's Hour stalwart Jenni Murray, appearing as themselves.
