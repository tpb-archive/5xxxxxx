Go-To Telescopes Under Suburban Skies is the first book specifically written for amateur astronomers who own, or who are about to purchase, a computer-controlled â€˜go-toâ€™ telescope. Computer control and automatic location of objects in the night sky is now a feature of even inexpensive astronomical telescopes (under $200), no longer just of the more expensive models. The advantage of the â€˜go-toâ€™ capability is enormous â€“ the telescope can be aimed at any object in the sky with great speed and accuracy â€“ and so is the popularity of these instruments.

GO-TO Telescopes Under Suburban Skies provides literally hundreds more targets beyond those offered by the built-in â€˜nightly toursâ€™ that feature on the telescopeâ€™s computer handset (a feature incorporated by most manufacturers). Although most â€˜go-toâ€™ telescopes have enormous databases of objects they can find â€“ usually running into tens of thousands â€“ the tours (thatâ€™s suggested objects to look at) are always very limited. Once youâ€™ve seen the planets and bright objects that the computer suggests, youâ€™re on your ownâ€¦

This new book answers the question, â€˜What shall I observe next?â€™ in a way that is unique to â€˜go-toâ€™ telescopes. Unlike all existing books on deep sky observing, GO-TO Telescopes Under Suburban Skies doesn't waste space on RA/Dec co-ordinates or Star Maps and Finder Charts for suggested objects. It is designed expressly to be used alongside a â€˜go-toâ€™ telescope, using the NGC and SAO menus on the computer handset to quickly slew the telescope to each new target. This is unique, and makes the book much more information-rich than other observing guides.

Targets are arranged by season to maximise the chances of a given object being visible at the time of observing, and then are divided into four categories: three deep sky categories of increasing difficulty, and then one category of stars that covers things like coloured stars, multiple stars, and loose clusters/streams. The reader can quickly turn to the relevant season, and then work through the list of objects.

All existing books about practical deep-sky observing are biased towards non-â€˜go-toâ€™ telescope owners and usually assume large-aperture instruments and/or dark, rural or desert skies. This book makes the more realistic assumption that the amateur astronomer has a relatively small telescope and is observing from a backyard in a suburban area.

Instead of devoting page after page to maps and co-ordinates, GO-TO Telescopes Under Suburban Skies leaves the computer to locate targets by using NGC and SAO catalog numbers, and so has the space to suggest many more fascinating deep-sky targets and provide detailed observing lists and information about what's being viewed...........................
