FIFA 11 reinvents player authenticity on and off the ball for
every player and at every position on the pitch with Personality+, an
all-new feature that sees individual abilities reflected in game
enabling clear differentiation for every player

With Personality+ a footballer s abilities on the pitch is mirrored
authentically in game, creating individual personalities. Players will
be distinguished from one another through a sophisticated database that
evaluates and grades each player s skill-set over 36 attributes and 57
traits, compiled by 1700 scouts around the world. Real Madrid s Kaka
will deliver crisp, creative passes, Barcelona s Andres Iniesta will
utilize tighter turns and close control to dribble through defenses
Manchester United s Wayne Rooney will hold off defenders and strike
shots from distance with pace, and top-flight defenders like Giorgio
Chiellini of Juventus will anticipate, predict and react to offensive
players to win back possession

Goalkeepers have also been injected with Personality+. The real-life
personality of the keeper, whether acrobatic or traditional, will
dictate his style in game. Dive attributes will determine the keepers
with the ability to reach for further shots while reflex attributes
determine reaction times, so a keeper like Petr Cech of Chelsea FC will
show be able to showcase world-class skills

Building on the FIFA 10 gameplay that won 50 sports game of the year
awards, FIFA 11 introduces new Pro Passing where pass accuracy is
determined by a gamer s ability on the control pad, and player skill
situation and urgency on the pitch, yielding a deeply rewarding passing
system. Plus, a series of new customization tools will enable fans to
transform FIFA 11 in new and personally meaningful ways. Assign
customized chants for every team and league and play music tracks from
your existing library from within the game.
