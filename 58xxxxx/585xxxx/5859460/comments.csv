I had to make just a couple of things.

1) Change the languange from russian to English.

2) Install VMWare audio driver.
here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/vmsvga2/files/

EnsoniqAudioPCI_1.0.2_for_SnowLeopard.mpkg.tar.gz 

3) Updated the Apple software available (2010-10-16) and worked fine.

,heddle,2010-11-08T03:29Z,"@dopsleutel13

I kept getting stalled at the ""green monster"" as well. Here is what I did to get it to boot.

1. Select inside the VM window to set the focus to the OS
2. Press F5 to bring the Apple logo to the first position.
3. Move the arrows to highlight the Apple logo
4. Don't press Enter, press the Down arrow to reveal boot options
5. Move down to the boot option
6. Press Enter"
[V],Anacondaz,2010-11-14T03:02Z,"i have vmware installed
now what are the steps to install this os 
pls any one reply
thanks for the nice upload mate"
[V],Anacondaz,2010-11-16T01:50Z,"plz anyone tell me the steps to use this os plsss
anyone"
[T],JugzG0nn4G3tY4,2010-11-17T05:21Z,"Steps:

1. Install and Register VMWare Workstation 7.
2. Restart, and enable ""Hardware Virtualization."" (If you do not have this in BIOS then you cannot run image, sorry :( )
3. Download this torrent.
4. Download 7 Zip or any program like it.
5. UnZip/UnRar/Un7Zip files to a location of your choice.
6. Launch VMWare Worksation.
7. Select ""Open Existing VM or Team""
8. Browse to where you extracted files.
9. Select ""MacOs10.6.4."" (If it asks you to ""Take Ownership"" do so.)
10. First Run, do not change settings.
11. ""Power on this virtual machine.""
12. If screen opens asking you whether you ""Moved it"" or ""Copied it"" the default is the copied option but I would choose the moved option.
13. It will do some booting things.
14. When you see the empire efi screen, click on the screen so that you are ""In"" the virtual machine.
15. Press F5.
16. Using your arrow pad, hit the ""Left"" arrow to chose the ""mac"" named hard drive.
17. On arrow pad again, hit the ""Down"" arrow.
18. Go down once more to the ""Boot Verbose"" option.
19. A whole bunch of text will show. Maybe even some errors, don't sweat it!
20. Mac Screen should pop up about 60 seconds later.
21. OH NO ITS RUSSIAN!!!!!
22. On the bottom of Mac desktop, hit the gear looking icon (system preferences.)
23. In the top category select the thing that looks like a flag, should be on the far right.
24. Click and drag English to the top.
25. Go to next tab and chose the top two tabs to ""U.S. English"" and ""English (United States).""
26. Exit out of that screen.
27. Since you must log out to make changes, on main desktop page hit the Apple symbol in top left corner.
28. The ""Log Out"" option is the very last one at the bottom of the list.
29. After you log out, it will ask you for your password.

THERE IS NO PASSWORD! JUST HIT ENTER! THAT'S ALL!

Hope this helps everyone. It worked for me.

Follow my instructions again except when it comes time to hit F5, just wait about a minute after you have click into the virtual os. After that waiting a minute, you should now hit F5, and follow steps again. This should work. It just has some issues. What can you expect? But let me know if it doesn't work still."

,bubble52,2011-04-30T22:22Z,"How to RESIZE the partition: (this took me a while to figure out, so i want to share it with you guys). USE AT YOUR OWN RIKS, MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A BACKUP OF YOUR DATA ON THE VIRTUAL MAC.

1. Shut down MacOS, edit the virtual machine settings in VMware, expand the virtual hard disk to the desired size (35GB, say).

2. Set up some Linux distro (eg Ubuntu) in VMware, install gdisk (www.rodsbooks.com/gdisk/) on this virtual Ubuntu if not present. Power down Ubuntu, edit virtual machine settings, Add... Hard Disk and select the MacOS virtual disk. Start Ubuntu, edit this MacOS disk with gdisk from within Ububtu: select â€œexpert modeâ€ 'x', run command 'e' (move backup GPT data structures to the end of the disk). Confirm write of GUID partition table. Switch off Ubuntu.

3. Power up MacOS, run Disk Utility, go to â€œPartitionâ€ and enlarge the â€œmacâ€ volume.

Step 2 is essential since MacOS uses a GUID Partition Table (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table). After step 1, the secondary GPT header still sits 20GB offset from the start of the disk and blocks any partition enlargement attempts.

Hope that works!"
,brianxxx,2011-05-18T18:42Z,"This is not made to work properly with AMD processors.

There are 2 blends - ones for Intel and ones for AMD.

Most of the time, the AMD setup and configs that must be done are very different.

People with Intel CPUs will have a much easier time. Notice that all the sites that support this, make these, mod, etc. all work with Intel or warn you if you are trying to do this with an AMD.
