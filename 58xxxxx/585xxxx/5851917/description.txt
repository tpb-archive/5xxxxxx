The Year of the Boar introduces the powerhouse bassist's new band, a five-piece
that reflects his adopted home in the American prairie (he's lived in Chicago
since late 2006) as well as his deep roots in the bustling Norwegian jazz
scene. The result is nothing short of a full marshaling of trans-Atlantic
creative music forces, a roundhouse punch in the face of complacent listening.

Of course, parallels between the improvised music communities in Chicago and
Oslo have been made frequently, fueling repeated exchanges between the
metropoles. Top pan-Scandanavian ensembles like Atomic and The Thing, both of
which feature Flaten on bass, have toured the U.S. regularly over the last
half-decade, prying open the door to a fruitful musical give-and-take. This
group is the next chapter in this ongoing saga.

The quintet's debut CD feels natural in Chicago, with a pugilistic rock element
(listen to Parker's white-hot guitar soloing and the band's raucous ostinati
riffing) and sectional, episodic compositions. But as with any important record,
it adds something distinctly personal and original to the mix, which might be
summarized by placing the band in a great lineage of Norwegian progressive
jazz. With a constructive approach to the integration of fusion charts and
post-Miles electric collage, significant points on that line include Jan
Garbarek's classic, sometimes unfairly neglected early bands with guitarist
Terje Rypdal, which perhaps set the aesthetic table for Flaten's ensemble, and
the George Russell ensembles out of which Garbarek's group emerged, as well as
the less well-known trio led by pianist Svein Finnerud.

In fact, Flaten makes his awareness of this tradition clear at the end of the
disc, utilizing a line by Finnerud's bassist (and Flaten's good friend), BjÃ¸rnar
Andresen in the composition "George," which he dedicates to Russell. Other
pieces have appeared in very different versions elsewhere, showing how Flaten
likes to rework and reinterpret material. Indeed, the blazing opener, "Maxwell's
Silver Demon," also appeared as the first track on Flaten's Jazzland release
Quintet, but the bassist was confident that the differences in the two versions
would be evident, maybe even instructive. From one of the first trips to
Chicago, Flaten's piece "Green Wood" appeared on the 2003 Okka Disk release
Nuclear Assemblyhall, performed by the combined forces of Atomic and School
Days. Here, on a rolling groove that builds to a volcanic explosion, Rosaly
shows off his polyrhythmic imagination.

Dedications to Flaten's parents constitute two tracks. "Praying," a track that
has appeared on an early Atomic release (Feet Music) and uncredited on Zim
Nqguana's Ingoma, a South African CD, is a dedication to Flaten's father, who
died when the bassist was 20. "Ceremony," a new piece with a beautiful pocket
and Art Ensemble-like rhythmic breakdowns, dedicated to Flaten's mother (soon to
be revisited on a new AtomicSchooldays release), was debuted on the tour for The
Year of the Boar, during which Flaten played in his home village, Oppdal, for
the first time since leaving in 1988. His 77-year-old mom was in the first
row. At the end of the concert, one of the 500 in attendance, an old farmer who
had never heard live jazz, said to Ingebrigt: "Man, this music went straight to
my guts."

No wonder. It takes little expertise to feel the strength and sensitivity of the
Ingebrigt Haker Flaten Quintet. Here they are in the city that works, helping
build a new Chicago.
