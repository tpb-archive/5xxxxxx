What are you talking about? I've played both versions, and they were exactly the same... there were no missing cut scenes in AiTB's previous torrent, and the graphics were fine. Must have just been you.

@O_-me-_R

Completely agree with everything you said... i finished this game on medium difficulty in about 5 or 6 hours. I guess when you're used to playing games like FO3, and Just Cause, Mass Effect, Dragons Age, etc, etc, games like this just seem like a waste of time. They could have made it so much better...

Yes.

@lukegoodman2001

Perhaps your computer can't handle the game? It was fine for me, stayed at a steady 30FPS for most of the gameplay... dropped down a little here and there. As for the cannon part, i posted above that you will have to start from a previous save file(not the same one), it's a bug that should fix itself... hopefully. You must take the power cell out of the furthest cannon... if you can't remove it, then the bug is still there and you will have to go back to a different save and play through again.

,bigrog711,2010-10-31T17:00Z,"How to Install: For Noobs

1. Unrar.

   This means the is a zip file in this download. 
   You can open this file with winzip, winrar, or 7-zip.
   Within this zip file there is usually an .iso file.
   Extract it to someplace you can easily remember.

2. Burn or mount the image.

   The ""image"" is this .iso file.
   You have 2 choices here.

   1) Burn, this is burning it to a disk using any CD burning program.
      (Nero and Roxio are popular burning programs.)

   2) Mount, this is using a program to create a virtual disk drive on your computer.
      Once the virtual drive is created, you ""mount"" the ""image"" a.k.a. ""load"" the ""file"" 
      onto this virtual drive.
      (Popular programs include Daemon Tools and Alcohol Soft.)

3. Install the game.

   Now you can install the game.
   You either load it from the disk you burnt, or load it from your 
   virtual drive after the ""image"" is ""mounted"".
   (Installs just like any other game.)

4. Copy over the cracked content.

   CD or mounted image, you can explore the files in/on the .iso file a.k.a. the disk.
   Once file explorer is open and you are viewing the contents of the disk,
   look for a folder labeled ""Crack(s)"". Copy the contents of this folder to replace the
   files in the installed folder.
   (These will usually be .exe and .dll files, maybe more.)

5. Play the game.

   You may now begin playing the game.
   Make sure you have replaced the .exe that came with the install, 
   with the one that comes in the ""Cracked"" folder.

To all the people who didn't bother reading any of the comments before complaining, i posted a somewhat ""fix"" for the Salvation's Bridge bug.

To clarify, the bug in question is the level where you need to remove the powercell from the cannon, and place it into the broken cannon to shoot the door out. The bug prevents the power cell from being removed... at all.

TO FIX THIS... you need to restart the level from a PREVIOUS save game. don't just replay the level, because the bug will still be there. You NEED to load a new save... even if it means repeating the entire level or the level before. Restarting from another save *should* fix the bug itself.

Hope that helps."

Wasting your time? I took time out of my schedule to offer one(apparently not 100% effective) fix for a problem many people, including myself, were experiencing, and i am ""wasting *your* time""?

I could spend the rest of this reply explaining to you, and every one else reading this, in great detail, how much of an ungrateful prick you most likely are, but i'm not going to do that, instead i'm going to say i'm sorry my suggestion apparently did not work for you in this instance. I will add it worked brilliantly for me and many other people that were experiencing this annoying issue. Perhaps you just need to learn how to install games properly, or maybe try not being so cheap and go buy it(which i did as an x-mas present for my little nephew).

exactly my opinion. the story is very weak, a bad copy of the 1st one without new characters. gameplay is ok for the most part except for not having much tougher jedi bosses to fight against (like it's predecessor, which was much more fun/of a challenge) if you liked the 1st one you gonna be disappointed with this."

,TyMod,2011-09-05T22:13Z,"FOR ANYONE TRYING TO REINSTALL READ BELOW!!!

Needed to catch your eyes.

64 bit computers: Search REGEDIT in the search option and run it as ADMIN.  Then goto HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\LucasArts\Star Wars The Force Unleashed 2 and delete the entire folder.  All done, install the force unleashed 2. :)

32 bit computers do the same but goto HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\LucasArts\Star Wars The Force Unleashed 2 and delete the entire folder.

ALL DONE. You may now reinstall The Force Unleashed 2.  Your welcome.

TyMoD."

Also if you are trying to patch it then you must download the European version NOT THE USA/AMERICAN VERSION.

,TtToker,2012-01-26T06:48Z,"you selfish assholes come here and download these torrents for free and when somebody else needs something, rather than helping them you just talk shit and act like you never had a problem in your life. you were born with the knowledge to do everything and never had to ask for help in your life. I used to believe in Karma but seeing you ass holes leach this shit then come on here just to rag on others with trouble otherwise. some of you people really don't deserve the luxury of torrents.  
Thank you AiTB for the upload. +Karma to you and @Sivos and others like him, fuck you. "
,Rezol,2012-02-14T17:38Z,"IF YOU CAN'T PATCH THE GAME!

This is because you have already cracked the .exe and the patcher won't recognize it.
THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE TO REINSTALL!
Mount or unpack the CD-image, then explore it and go to the bin folder. In there is the ORIGINAL SWTFU2.exe which you can copy to the game directory to ""uncrack"" the game. After that you can patch without problem!"
,Joniht,2012-02-14T20:33Z,"I can't play this game because i don't have SP3 for Windows XP and i can't install one because my Windows isn't original.
