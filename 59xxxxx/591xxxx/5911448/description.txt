MAAM DC-3 *NO-STRESS INSTALLATION* FOR FSX SP2/Acceleration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


WHY:
----
This torrent was compiled by me because the installation of the MAAM DC-3 for FSX is a real PITA:
- You'll have to fiddle around MAAM's website and find out the exact packages to install _prior_ to the main package's installation:
- Then, you'll have to install these packages into a fixed directory [C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games\Flight Simulator 9], even if you don't have a C drive, or even if you already have FS9 installed in another place
- After that, you'll have to move those installed aircraft folders to the simobjects..
- Then you install the main FSX packages and the ServicePack1..
- And finally, you have to replace in ALL TEXTURE FOLDERS the transparency fix for FSX SP2/Acceleration

I hope NOW you understand WHY this package was created :)


HOW:
----
Just drop all the folders into FSX\SimObjects\Airplanes folder. Done! _Every_ plane was tested in FSX with Acceleration Pack!


WHO:
----
This package is for all new-schooler fans of the Dc-3 who use mainly FSX (like me), and especially dedicated to the FANS OF THE ICE Pilot Tv Show series! JUST GET IT!


Regards.


PS: I've only added one extra livery.. a gift for the Ice Pilot's fans :) Enjoy!
