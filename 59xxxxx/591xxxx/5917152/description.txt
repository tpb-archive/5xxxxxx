Part two in the very good Hardcore Syndrome series, this album has more emphasis on the trance and happy-hardcore side of the Hardcore Tano*C circle. A pretty enjoyable album, with a few tracks to keep in a permanent library.
This album has some really fresh styles across ranging through the gamut of happy hardcore all the way to some bangin\\\' gabber -- a nice treat in the piss-stained generic and bland swamplands of the modern music industry.


I enjoy the entirety of this album, though a few tracks stand out popularity-wise:
Serotonin 2008 (Trance/Hardcore) - Joshka/JAKAZiD, some really incredible synth buildups. Joshka\\\'s highest last.fm track by far.

Cross Breeding (Hardcore) - REDALiCE, named such because it twists from dark and intense riffs to a happy-hardcore bridge in the middle and back again. Fun track, the second-highest ranking track on REDALiCE\\\'s long-term last.fm playcounts. That means its good =P

The third track of popular note is Olive (Hard Trance) - Umbrella, his highest play-count track on last.fm. Enjoyable, though I wouldn\\\'t say mind-blowing.
