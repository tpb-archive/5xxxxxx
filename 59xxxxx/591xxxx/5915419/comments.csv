The man goes up to hit first. He swings and hits the ball 100 yards. The golf pro says not bad. Golfpro: ""Now hold the club as firm as you hold your wife's breasts"". The man follows instructions and hits the ball 300 yards. The golf pro says ""Excellent!"" Now the woman takes her turn. Her ball goes 30 yards. Golfpro: ""Not bad, try holding the club like you hold your husbands dick."" She swings and the ball goes 10 yards. Golfpro: ""Not bad, but now try taking the club out of your mouth and hit the ball."""
