[AECD-013] 2008
MP3 LAME 3.98.4 320kbps
Hardcore, Trance



This is one of the better Touhou Arrange albums out there. Let it be said that REDALiCE is amazing, and so are the tracks "taboo tears you up 2008", "Locked Girl (Trancecore Remix)", "Thalia", and "Volar". A weird blend of trance and hardcore, and by extension some very solid J-Core.
