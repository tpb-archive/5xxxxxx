NZV8 Magazine. January 2011.

English | 112 pages | PDF | 74.2 Mb

NZV8 Magazine was conceived when the passionate muscle car scene 
was in need of an authority. Thanks to a large population of baby 
boomers, muscle car and V8 culture is starting to boom again in 
New Zealand. NZV8 is not only riding that wave, but leading the 
way by providing world class magazine that features the cars, 
events and people that make the scene so exciting. NZV8 covers 
an extensive range of high performance V8-engine vehicles. 
Wherever the local ground shakes to the beat of a tuned eight 
cylinder machine, NZV8 is part of the action.

Enjoy.
