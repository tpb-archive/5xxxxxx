You provide so much shit I cancelled my dvr and cable service, every show I watch you provide. Even though I don't comment on every torrent ( I always forget my username and password) which I should, I want to thankyou for all the work you put in to provide this. All your video and audio quality are legit, and you give the option to download better quality files or ones that take up less space, thanks."
