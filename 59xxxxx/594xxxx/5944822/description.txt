WinZip also provides advanced photo and image compression. With a single click, you can compress your digital photographs and graphic images by 20-25% with no loss of quality or data integrity. This lets you send files faster and fit more on your flash drive, CD/DVD, or hard disk.

Encrypt and password-protect your files as you zip them, all in one easy step! You can even define your own password policies that WinZip will enforce for each file you encrypt.
As an added security measure, WinZip also auto-wipes or "shreds" temporarily extracted copies of encrypted files using the U.S. Department of Defense standard (DoD 5220.22-M). This automatic action prevents protected files from being recovered and misused

Use WinZip to organize and compress your data into convenient, logical groups that are perfect for sharing! Smaller file sizes translate to faster uploading/downloading times and hassle-free email attachments that don't clog email servers.

You can set WinZip to backup selected data files, and you can schedule those backups to run automatically and unattended.
