Release notes:

Besides selling 40 million albums and winning 9 Grammys in less than 10 years,
over the years Norah Jones has collaborated with dozens and dozens of artists
from across the spectrum of music. This album collects Norah's favorite
collaborations from 2001-2010 into one amazing collection: legends like Ray
Charles, Willie Nelson and Herbie Hancock, rock artists ranging from Foo
Fighters to Ryan Adams to Belle and Sebastian, hip hop luminaries OutKast, Q-Tip
and Talib Kweli. No matter the genre however, Norah's enchanting voice is the
common denominator and while the partners are varied, she ends up owning every
song and this album is a wonderful collection that holds together brilliantly.
The album is a testament to Norah's status as one of the most in-demand and
tasteful musical connectors in music.

Enjoy!
