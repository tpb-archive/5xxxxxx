Do you have the WAT update installed, KB971033? If yes you may have got flagged as non-genuine, in order to become genuine again just do the following.

* Launch the loader application and select to uninstall
* Restart the PC
* Install the loader and restart the PC
* Visit the following website to revalidate Windows: www.microsoft.com/genuine/   (You may need to set IE to compatibility mode!)

####

Is Windows failing to boot after you installed the loader? Just do the following.

* Boot up the PC from your Windows installation disk
* Select the \"Repair your computer\" option
* Select \"Command Prompt\"
* Input \"bootsect.exe /nt60 SYS /force\" (without quotes)
* Restart the PC

Note: If the above doesn\'t fix your boot issue then use the command \"bootsect.exe /nt60 ALL /force\" instead. Just make sure you remove all USB flash drives before you use the command.

####

If you have previously used another activation solution and have been marked as non-genuine then you first need to uninstall the software you used or just format and start fresh.

####

Q. I received the error message \"Error finding your systems active partition\", what do I have to do?
A. You need to format the whole hard drive with a program like Active@ Kill Disk. This issue is caused by your locked OEM partition. http://software.lsoft.net/boot-cd-iso.zip

Q. I received the error message \"Failed to add loader to the boot code\", what do I have to do?
A. Disable any system protection. Some types of software block the loader application from installing to the boot code.

Q. I\'ve used a version of the loader before and it failed to work, what do I have to do?
A. If you previously used bootsect to get back into Windows then you first need to press uninstall, reboot and then install the newest version of the loader.

Q. Why was table sorting changed so that it\'s now disabled by default?
A. Some machines don\'t like the table order being changed so to make the loader more system compatible we disabled it by default.

Q. I\'ve previously used another activation solution and I think it\'s modified my systems files, can I fix it?
A. You can first try to uninstall what you originally installed and then try running \"sfc.exe /scannow\" from command prompt as an administrator.

Q. I\'ve got Linux on another partition/drive, is there anything I should know?
A. Use the preserve current boot code option.

Q. How can I use BitLocker, TrueCrypt or another boot manager?
A. First setup the software and then install the loader with the option selected to preserve the current boot code.

Q. I lose activation status after my systems been to sleep or has been in hibernation, can I fix it?
A. Go to the advanced options and select to disable type 4 memory, install the loader again and see if that cures it. If you\'re not cured try to disable type 3 memory instead. If it still fails try selecting the legacy setting.

Q. I installed the loader and my system hangs during the boot process, can I fix it?
A. Go to the advanced options and select to disable type 4 memory, install the loader again and see if that cures it. If you\'re not cured try to disable type 3 memory instead. If it still fails try selecting the legacy setting.

Q. I installed the loader and rebooted but I\'m not activated. The loader application displays the message \"BAD SLIC SIZE\" or \"BAD SLIC DATA\", can I fix it?
A. Uninstall the loader, power down and then boot up the system again. Go to the applications advanced options and select to ignore the existing SLIC and then press install.

If a certificate or SLIC is released and I have not put out a new version of my application
simply create two folders, one called \"Certificates\" and another called \"SLICs\".

In each folder put the files you want to add support for, just be sure you label the files
like this:

*Certificates folder*
Acer.XRM-MS
Advent.XRM-MS
Alienware.XRM-MS
Asus.XRM-MS


*SLICs folder*
Acer.BIN
Advent.BIN
Alienware.BIN
Asus.BIN


When using external files all preset internals will be ignored, this is a cleaner approach
for users who want to build their own list without my presets getting in the way.

Everyone who supports this project, you\'re all the reason I\'m still working on it.
