About the Course

There is one thing I can be sure of: I am going to die. But what am I to make of that fact? This course will examine a number of issues that arise once we begin to reflect on our mortality. The possibility that death may not actually be the end is considered. Are we, in some sense, immortal? Would immortality be desirable? Also a clearer notion of what it is to die is examined. What does it mean to say that a person has died? What kind of fact is that? And, finally, different attitudes to death are evaluated. Is death an evil? How? Why? Is suicide morally permissible? Is it rational? How should the knowledge that I am going to die affect the way I live my life?

Q U E S T I O N :

Before I download this I would like to know if it is pro/anti religion, or unbiased. Thanks.


A N S W E R :

Thank you for a very good question!

The lecturer in this course acknowledges that people may have various religious beliefs about the nature of death, morality, afterlife and immortality, based upon what they read from scripture or learn from their family traditions. THAT IS NOT A SUBJECT OF THIS COURSE.

The subject of the course is to examine what we can say about the topic of death, souls, immortality, morality, personal identity and so on WITHOUT resorting to arguments based solely upon traditional beliefs or sources of "divine revealed authority". Religion is in other words NOT a subject of this course AT ALL.

This is a philosophy course in the true sense of the word - based on unbiased thinking and reasoning and looking at difficult problems from multiple perspectives.

What I really appreciate about this course is the way the lecturer works through the issues from both sides of the argument. And sometimes there are problems where we end up with arguments with more than two "sides" such as a body-view, a personality-view and a soul-view - all of which are examined in great detail. And we do not always end up with one side as the sole victor.

Be prepared for some serious and mind opening thinking.

By the way, the professor lecturing is one of the most enthusiastic and clear spoken teachers I've ever heard, and luckily he also does have a good sense of humor.
