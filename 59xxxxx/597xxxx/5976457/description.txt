In this edition of Press TV's 'On the Edge with Max Keiser', Max talks about world oil production and has an interview with Gregor Macdonald.

The globe runs on oil but it appears as though oil is running out. The International Energy Agency (IEA) in Paris just released their projections for world oil production by type. What is the significance of the IEA projections? This is the question that Max asks Gregor Macdonald of gregor.us where he writes monthly newsletter on energy and economics.

 It is my opinion that in this time it is virtually
 essential to seek information from a variety of sources, 
 to listen to a spectrum of voices in order to better 
 understand the "big picture." A reliance solely upon
 mainstream corporate media for news and info is a 
 prescription for ignorance. I try to share information
 that counters the monotone of mainstream corporate media.

 Think for yourself! To paraphrase the late William Cooper: 
 Read everything, listen to everything, but believe nothing 
 until you've researched it yourself.
