-> Your settings are stored in the 'MSOffice2007Settings' folder, delete it to start fresh.

Note: 'Delete Thumbnails' deletes all thumbnails stored in the 'MSOffice2007Settings' folder and prevents them from coming back (since they can grow to hundreds of megabytes).  It must be re-applied if you delete the 'MSOffice2007Settings' folder.

Note: Excel links to files within Word, so if you rename 'Microsoft Word 2007' Excel won't open.
