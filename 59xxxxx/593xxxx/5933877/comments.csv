,sgyfrend,2011-10-01T19:31Z,"This ""Professor"" is ridculously bias. Not only does he admit to be ""an unabashed patriot,"" but his view of history is molded to fit his beliefs. For example. during his lecture on Constantine, he said the general was a ""convinced Christian."" The issue of Constantine's piety is still a point of contention for scholars, as the TTC Greccoroman History ironically points this ou

Rufus is also anti-Muslim. Whenever he brings up Islam, he likes to mention the Ghazi: a group of warrior committed to exterminating the infidel and spread Islam. He never introduced the murderous and corrupt crusader. However, Christians and Jews were recognized by Islam, and the only ""Infidels"" were Atheists and Paegans, an oppressed group that Rufus conveniently omits. Calling the Bolsheviks terrorists is just another example of his near-revisionist approach. Regardless, lectures like that regarding the Buddha and the scientific lectures that forbid his opinion are useful."
,Diarrhea_Moustache,2011-10-21T17:42Z,"I agree with sgyfrend. This is REALLY DISAPPOINTING.  One of the events that supposedly changed history was Moses and the Exodus.  Modern historians more or less agree that there never were Hebrew slaves in Egypt and the Book of Exodus is totally fictional.  Even if it were true-- would it really be so important as to be mentioned in this course?  If you have a high school diploma, you pretty much won't learn anything new from this.  And if you have an IQ in the double digits you won't find it at all stimulating.  Go for another course."
