Overview:
==========
Install/uninstall programs are very common in this broadband world. People download programs every day and install them, lucky ones get the chance to serve you, but the others, they have to go.


What's the problem?
====================
Let's say you frequently install trial versions of programs to check them out. And let's also say that, after giving them a shot, you don't like them and decide to uninstall them. Unfortunately, you find it impossible to uninstall some of them - they remain on the Windows installed programs list even they are "supposedly" gone. These improperly uninstalled programs can also be the cause of errors because many junk files and registry keys/values were left behind on your PC. These 'junk artifacts' can - and do - cause system problems and slow down Windows substantially.
