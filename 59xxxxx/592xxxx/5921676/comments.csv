,darknight100,2010-10-30T13:29Z,Inception is the living truth that Hollywood can prolong or just avoid the quick ripping of their movies if only they wish to. Makes one wonder.

,Funky_Koval,2010-10-30T23:37Z,"Why on earth so many uploaders cut files to 700MB parts?! We have year 2010 now. CD-ROM is relict. If you still burn 700MB CDs, why don't you burn DVDs? It cost the same and you have much more memory to manage. Why don't you make rip in one file 1GB/1.5GB/2GB?"
,willis00,2010-10-30T23:51Z,"Awesome movie, but it makes no sense

Can someone explain it to me indepth?"

That's a great attitude towards someone who used their own time and effort to give others something FOR FREE. He did not force you to download this, he did not make you pay for it. Why are you whining so much?

Who is the douchebag now?"
,wononkin,2010-11-03T00:23Z,"Hey REVIEWER, you're a fucking idiot..It's a free movie, go fuck yourself for complaining.  Also, Dennis, you are almost just as stupid.  You can burn damn near any size movie to a DVD or Blueray..I don't even understand where you would get the whole 700mb limit thing..Get ConverXtoDVD or one of the many similar programs.  God I hate complainers when it comes to getting something for nothing...Thanks Raymondhome for the work."

,chazzo125,2010-12-24T22:47Z,I note that Warner has issued an 'infringing?' comment on some torrents for this film. I am sure I am not alone alone in wishing Warner a 'warner' inviting them to let loose tears and any other discharged fluid via normal bodily orifices! It might relieve your stress and suffering Warner & Co over Yuletide! I am equally sure millions of us p2p sharers will cry a huge deluge of crocodile tears in sympathy! :)
