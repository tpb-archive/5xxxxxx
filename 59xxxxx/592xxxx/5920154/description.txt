An international conspiracy has placed the UKâ€™s most secretive bio-chemical
project into deadly hands, and only Her Majestyâ€™s most lethal agent, James
Bond, can unravel the mystery. To navigate through layers of corruption,
you, as Bond, will embark on a global chase that will have you battling on
land, sea, and air through Athens, Istanbul, Monaco, and Bangkok. Nothing is
what it seems as each adventure reveals a deeper and more sinister
conspiracy. Engage in precise cover-based gunplay and tactical firefights,
and speed your way through explosive adrenaline-fueled driving sequences.
Become Bond as he engages in intense hand-to-hand combat and uses his
environment to finish off enemies. Take the battle online in a 16-person
multiplayer mode that requires skill, teamwork and strategy as you compete
in matches that will have spies battling mercenaries. In the fight to
prevent the worldâ€™s most dangerous weapon from falling into the wrong
hands, youâ€™ll need to be the ultimate secret agent.
