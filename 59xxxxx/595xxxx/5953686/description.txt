STORM CHASERS' teams are on the scene recording data and gathering research in order to improve early warning systems. This fall, viewers will get a front row seat to nature's fury in the heart of "Tornado Alley" as scientists, researchers and weather enthusiasts gear up and strap in for their pursuit of the ultimate tornado footage.

This season, viewers witness how the courageous STORM CHASERS used science to save lives last spring, which was one of the most violent storm seasons on record. Extreme meteorologist Reed Timmer reunites with chasing partner Joel Taylor in their armored chase vehicle "The Dominator" for the exciting fourth season joined IMAX filmmaker Sean Casey and his monster tank-like TIV (Tornado Intercept Vehicle) and veteran researcher and storm chaser Tim Samaras.
