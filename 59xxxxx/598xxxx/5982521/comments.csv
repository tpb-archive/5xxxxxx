,fakebest,2010-11-24T23:03Z,"@BigDet which ixtreme? it is a newer game so you would need ixtreme 1.61 and up (1.6 with activation disc) 
I am unsure if this has ap2.5 but people with modded FW should not update there dashboard until ixtrme LT+  comes out or else new games will not work and you a have a higher chance of getting banned."

,SaltSlasher,2010-11-26T07:02Z,"I just wanted to let people know that on abgx360 it will pass everything except the verification.
Apparently abgx hasn't gotten it in their system yet but I went ahead a checked it out and this game is GOOD TO DOWNLOAD.
However I did not play online, I am able to play single player just fine so its up to you if you want to take a chance online at this point in time.
I am in america so it works with ntsc u for sure. 
Also this is a sequel to Redemption, this one starting where the first one ended so when you play this one, it starts out as everyone being a zombie!!!
So DL and SEED!
Thanks kill3rk!"
