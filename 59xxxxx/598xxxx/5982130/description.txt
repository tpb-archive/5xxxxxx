                             Death Curse Of Tartu 
                                 
Another fun Saturday Afternoon stinker.

A group of students on an archaeology assignment in the Everglades decide to throw 

a dance party one night. 

The spot they choose happens to be the burial site of an ancient Indian medicine 

man named Tartu. 

He returns from the dead to take his revenge on those who desecrated his grave 

site.
