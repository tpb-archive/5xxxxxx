Unlike most of the other .hack series, Liminality takes place in the real world rather than the game. In the .hack timeline, it takes place at the same time as the games: between SIGN and LotT (manga).

The first episode begins while Kite and BlackRose meet up with Meg in .hack//INFECTION. The second episode takes place during Outbreak on the same day Kite fights Cubia for the second time. The third episode takes place in mid December of 2010, roughly near the end of Outbreak. The final episode takes place December 24, 2010, during Kite's battle against Morganna.

Liminality follows former CC Corp employee Junichiro Tokuoka and his own "party" on their quest to find what links the mysterious comas with The World. Each of the first three episodes focuses more on their title characters while the fourth episode has them all working together.

Liminality is a term used in anthropology to refer to the transition period between two states. For instance a student who has completed all of the requirements for graduation, but not yet received his diploma is in a state of Liminality. In regards to .hack, the term is used to refer to the grey area between the game world, and the real world. As the characters who play within The World, don't belong entirely to either one, existing in a sort of grey zone between the two worlds.
