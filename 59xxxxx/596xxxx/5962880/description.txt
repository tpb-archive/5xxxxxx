Neurotically Yours by Ill Will Press Volume 1-6

Each Volume has been been encoded using h.264 to preserve original dvd quality while having a small file size.  Each video contains all episodes of that volume (at 400kbps), in total I believe there is 200 episodes if they were split up.  If a iso of volume 7 (episodes 201-225) which has been out since July 27th 2010 becomes available I will encode that and release it here and any volume after that.  The video files are mkv so play them with vlc or mpc, google is your answer to almost anything try it first.  If you were to get all the volumes separately (which are iso files from the dvd's then it would be 15.9GB compared to this which is 1.56GB with the same quality and you can easily play them with a video player instead of needing an iso mounting program like poweriso or burning the iso's to a disc but if you did want these on a disc you could fit them all on one dvd even if it is a video dvd and not just a data dvd, where as the separate iso's would take up a disc per volume.   Enjoy and comment if needed.
