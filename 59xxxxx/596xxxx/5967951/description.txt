           Forget about nuclear missiles, the decisive weapon of the      
           twentieth century is the car bomb. After Iraq we now know      
           you can defeat a Superpower, start a civil war or just         
           blow up your own Government with a trunk load of               
           home-made explosives and a battered old car. From the          
           Middle East, Oklahoma, Ireland and the streets of the          
           City of London the car bomb has shaped human conflict.         
           Even today the car bomb remains the number one terrorist       
           threat across the world. In this film, ex-CIA agent            
           Robert Baer uncovers the history of this extraordinary         
           weapon. With footage of car bomb attacks and interviews        
           with car bombers, Baer reveals how the century of the car      
           turned into the century of the car bomb. And how a dream       
           of freedom turned nightmare.
