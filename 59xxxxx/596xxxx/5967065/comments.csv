#2
Click the ""Options"" button on the left side of the window, then click the ""Program"" tab.
#3
Remove the check from the box labeled ""Load the program at Windows startup"" to prevent Spy Sweeper from launching automatically when Windows starts.
#4
Close the window when you are happy with your choices, then restart your computer to have Spy Sweeper restart with the options that you have selected.

Now after the above steps turn off any antivirus protection and firewall too,then extract it and run,then follow 'beast activator' steps.

Thanks for your kind attention.

Advanced Inventory feature is completely installed in our computers and runs from our computers, not an Intuit Workplace application that requires Internet access(just like payroll etc,.),but it requires one still have to be connected to the Internet just to check subscription status time to time and not every time one works with the advanced  inventory feature.

Recently I have an issue,at first on startup i receved message to check subscription status online,i clicked ""cancel"" it disappear and instead of opening company file it opened another message saying""three options""
1)buy subscription online
2)turn off advenced inventory feature for your company file
3)exit 

this way I am not able to work my company file,only way it says is to turn off advanced inventory feature and continue working.

Please help me.This feature is not a intuit workplace application,it completly installed and runs from our computers.

Hey man, First of all, I want to say Thanks for the strong work you do with activating all Quickbooks products.

I wanted to bring something to your Attn about Quickbooks POS v10 as the crack seems to interfere with the application now...

It worked fine initially but then after a day or two the application stopped responding (It would load the company file, but then the ""I want to"" button turned grey and you couldn't click or do anything) when launching the application. I removed the patch, and it started working fine - but I am sure now POS is going to phone home to Intuit and I am SOL.

I am not sure if/when you would be willing to take a look at POS and see if you can figure out what is causing the problems, but another glitch was in the Sales menu, when you ring up a Misc. Item, the keypad on the right hand side does not display the number ""3"" - It shows a ""4"" in its place, and when pressed also displays a ""4"" - not sure if this has been brought to your attention - I would really love to be able to use this software (and cracked) and would be willing to PayPal you money for your time if you can help get a stable crack out there - afterall, it's a hell of a lot cheaper than actually purchasing the program.

Anyways, Thanks again for your help - thought I would let you know what was going on.

,Beast_iND,2010-12-31T19:34Z,"@jonshonK:

I've tested it on both Win7 x64 and Windows XP and it worked... I ran into this too on one of the tests and had to do this to fix it:
- run apmanage_key.exe, then go to the registration screen
- Click ""Register by Fax"", then close the fax.
- Go back to the registration screen, type 1234567890 in and let in generate another code.
- Enter that code and click ""Test"".

You can see whether or not it is using your serial by clicking the Help / About screen. If it still says ""2 users"" it's not picking up the right data and the code won't work. By going through the ""Register by Fax"" thing inside apmanager_key.exe (instead of the unpatched apmanager.exe) a couple of times ended up working.

See if that helps."

Glad it worked and I didn't waste my time :)

Feel free to add corrections to the instructions as you see fit in case others run into the same issue with the invalid code.

Maybe the whole registration process can be done using apmanage_key.exe. The only reason I wanted you to only use it to generate the code is because I don't know if some of the functions I patched are used in other parts of the application, so to play it safe I thought all the data editing should be done using the regular, unpatched apmanage.exe. But maybe it works with the patched one too.

The Australian version of QuickBooks is different enough that this activator doesn't work.  Have you had a look at the Australian version?  I think this could be easily cracked by patching the features.dll file but my skills aren't quite up to that standard.  Can you offer any advice or assistance?"

I recently started using quickbooks and naturally am a huge fan of your work. Keep it up. Just wanted to find out few things from you. The only working version I could find (that is cracked) is 2008 uk version. Do you maybe know of any south african version that I could download (without paying obviously) and will any of your crack work on it if there is? Also if I wanted to use payroll for quickbooks, is there any good cracked ones out there that will work with my version of quickbooks (2008 uk R8)?

Thanks again"

I urgently need to get a premier edition to work with my sales orders. Please man can you help me out. I read in another upload of yours that you can change a pro edition to premier by changing few files. If you can tell me how and which files where to edit I will be forever grateful to you.

What do I put in there? "
,butbut,2011-05-16T00:59Z,"Quickbooks 2011 (v10) Canadian Info:

First, thanks to Beast for a great product.

I've been fooling around with QB Enterprise CA 2011 (v1) this weekend. 

If you want the trial license and product code to install a full version, here it is;

Quickbooks Enterprise Canadian 2011 (v10)
License:  3539-4034-6268-323

Product Code: 131-618

This will get you into trial mode - however, you'll still need to put in a proper key if you want to register, and it won't accept this product code for a registration.

I started brute forcing it, and i found that

131-618 

works as a product code, and will allow you to attempt to register it.

Once you enter that second code, it wants you to restart QB in a non-trial mode (i assume) When you go for the restart, QB won't run anymore.

If you install the full retail version, you can't use the demo license with the demo code, or even my second code.

That says to me, if we could find a license key that it accepts, the product key I've posted may work.

BUT - When installing the full retail version, you only have 3 attempts to enter a proper key/code combination, so you don't have a lot of chances to try different keys. 

I post this here in the hopes that others may have better luck, and will report back.

I'll post links later to the trial and retail versions of QB Ent 2011 CA for download if people like.

,need_qb,2012-06-29T09:10Z,"Ok it seems when you run the installer in Win XP it extracts all the installer files here:

C:Documents and Settings*USERNAME*Local SettingsTempProQBooks

You have 2 files here which are interesting: 'manifest.ecml' and 'intuit.spc.map.entitlementclient.install.dll'

Read 'EntitlementClientInstallLog.txt' file which is found C:Documents and Settings*USERNAME*Local SettingsTemp

I tried using PE Explorer disassembler to see whether the product keys were in any of the setup files.

Then I searched on Youtube ""how to make your own keygen"" and ""how to make your own crack"".

Interesting results: they suggest to use OllyDbg (a debugger) to make keygen or crack the setup file.

Beast_iND mind telling us which tools you used to crack QuickBooks?"

,need_qb,2012-06-30T05:12Z,"@Sykotic13: The download link for Accountant Edition is the same:

http://globalsmallbusiness.intuit.com/downloads/CA/QuickBooks/2012/dls/r1/QuickBooksCA2012.exe

It has all the editions and installs the one based on your Product Key i.e. Premier OR Pro.

Then after the install: you get to choose your Flavor: Accountant, Professional, Retail etc.

I already tried all the keys in this thread. None of them worked for 2012 :(


So without a Product key the above link is useless.

I gave up, because the YouTube videos are too fast, and many times the sample ""crackme"" file is not downloadable so you can follow along the video.

But do take a look.

They make it seem so easy :)

Maybe make your own screencast video of you learning and following the YouTube videos.

Because sometimes they don't mention which version of OllyDbg they are using, and other times the crackme file link in description is dead, other times they use a whole different Debugger/Disassembler.

To us this is like analyzing the Flame Virus :)

C:Documents and Settings/*USERNAME*/Local Settings/Temp/Pro/QBooks

Start with looking at the setup.exe file above in PE Explorer disassembler (it shows the various editions of Quickbooks)."

no I haven't checked it... coz installed pos 2013 on 7th June  . If you want to check this you can always change  your date and return to the actual date... 

But I am very sure that it will definitely work. Cause I use pos V9 and though it is registered but still some time it gives the error of invalid product number at start.. so at first i had reinstall windows and pos ... it was time consuming... so I came to this easy solution. 

Hope it works for every one... you guys can check it with pos v2013"
,piratedawg75,2012-07-02T05:42Z,"@ebudget - your trick works for QB 2013.

Although, you have to empty out the v8.0 if you installed it on Windows 7 and use QB POS 2013.

Thanks for sharing!"

Does this Activator work on QuickBooks Pro 2012?

Thanks"
,need_qb,2012-07-03T12:09Z,"@evail: This activator does NOT work on Quickbooks 2012.

But I am using a Trial version, so that could be the problem.

But you know I can always test it out for you, if you post your 2012 Product Key here :) :)"
,skrose,2012-07-03T15:02Z,"Activator worked great for QB Pro 2012, does anyone have a product code for QB Premier 2012 UK, or Premier Accountant Edition?"
,need_qb,2012-07-03T23:14Z,@skrose: I tried all the Product Keys on this thread? Care to tell me which Product Key you used to activate Quickbooks 2012?
