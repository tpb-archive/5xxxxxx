Deadsy was initially signed to Sire Records which was distributed by Warner Brothers. They actually recorded two albums for the label, the first self-titled and the second named "Commencement", but neither saw release. Both are circulating, but actual promotional copies of "Commencement" were produced and distributed to promote it's then impending release. Sire, unfortunately, lost their distribution deal with Warners which led to Deadsy gaining release from their contract. Because of close affiliations with Orgy and Korn the band was able to secure a deal with Korn's Elementree Records and distribution with Dreamworks and in 2002, a revised version of "Commencement" with several new tracks was released.

A video shoot for the original choice for first single, "Book of Black Dreams" was planned for June, but had to be rescheduled, and was later canceled when director Kenneth Anger actually heard the band's music. The official first single slated for release is 'Carrying Over', which will be released in two forms, the album version, and the acoustic version from the Family Values 2006 compilation album..
