,QoMSoL,2010-02-21T08:54Z,"@ zenmonky
Man, maybe you should keep your drunken ass away from good movies? Try some fuckin Uwe Boll bullshit and you'll learn what really sucks ass.

,iSeshan,2010-02-25T13:40Z,"Haven't seen the movie yet, but when I first heard it coming out, I knew it won't be as good as the first, it's hard to do a movie 10 years apart."
,iSeshan,2010-02-25T13:42Z,"Also, this better be a DVDRip and not a Cam. Don't waist my bandwidth >:| "
,neodude86,2010-02-25T18:19Z,extremezone always comes through perfect quality as far as i could tell maybe a little bit quiet but that could have just been my laptop but still whole thing is there excellent audio and video 10/10

,nhprm,2010-02-26T03:35Z,"Why say ""@sbtmin no it's a cam...see description you little spammer "" when your Tags say ""    The Boondock Saints II The Boondock Saints All Saints Day 2009 DVDRip XviD MAX "" DVDRIP!!!! and your description says ""The Boondock Saints II All Saints Day (2009) DVDRip XviD-MAX"" again DVDRIP!!!

Extremezone, you've had some issues lately that make me nervous about the safety of your content.  What with the complete denial thing on the Legion rip and this?

What gives? Nobody cares if it's a cam, and I'm always going to read comments and see what other people say, especially the ones you single out to call spammers when they're not spamming anywhere else on TPB.

Anyway, just thought a return to form from you would be nice, instead of this weird obfuscated behavior."
,nhprm,2010-02-26T03:40Z,"in fact, no where in your description are the three sequential letters C-A-M..."

,bhxho,2010-02-28T23:15Z,thanks
,AkaPhsyco,2010-03-01T11:53Z,"Hey MPAA you ever heard of innovation? 

Based on the condition of the movie industry over the past half of a decade, it would assuredly seem you haven't! 

Nice lame ass commercial at the beginning of your dvd menu's btw, ""You wouldn't steal a car would you!?"" 

Yea and Refer Madness was a factual depiction of marijuana use. 

The film industry has been separated from legitimate Art and Entertainment for half a century at least!

2tb and counting Dl'ed and believe me more to come!

Let me ask you this, the music industry got decimated by the digital pirate revolution, has music gotten any worse since? Haven't seen a NSYNC or Backstreet Boys in awhile. I wonder why that is?

If you really do it for the art, you should be happy to share your ""product"" and be happy with the theater tickets we buy!!!

Support Net Neutrality! Support the resistance against companies like Comcast trying to monopolize the internet and throttle innovation and connections! Write your congress/parliament, who's members time and again naively fail to understand how important a free and open internet is to this generation and the generations to come!

We all have grown up intimately connected to the internet. We've seen it sprout from a simple conversational tool in its public inception. Watched it grow into and industry must have with e-commerce. Blossom with sophisticated social networks and tools for musicians, amateur film makers and software designers to reach people in ways not even conceivable merely years ago.

 The fate of the internet; actual ""intellectual"" content, entrepreneurial availability and personal and artistic communication, is far too important to be left in the hands of people who have no reverence or little understanding. 

Thanks for your time and enjoy your content.
And thanks to all the up loaders like extremezone w/out people like them, none of this would be possible!"
,casperyedmore,2010-03-01T18:19Z,good video quality but horrible audio
,skogsfisk,2010-03-01T18:23Z,"Very bad movie, don't bother to download"
,random-critic,2010-03-02T15:23Z,"Trusted Review:

A: 10
V: 8 (on large T.V.)

As a fan of the original, I must say this movie is entirely different from the first instalment. The dialogue between the subcharacters is subpar, poorly executed. Film is not altogether terrible.  Same main characters. Several flashbacks. Watch the first one first if you haven't seen it..."
,random-critic,2010-03-02T15:27Z,"*** Thanks for the upload, for the 1000th time.

There are funny parts too, forgot to mention.

Die spammers. Pirate Bay Rocks!!!!!

Free movies rule."
,thesolcity,2010-03-02T19:10Z,"A/V 10 and 8.5, Movie is a 10,000 :P

Loved the fact everyone was in this one, but this movies jokes seemed to be focused on ass pounding and faggots, not that im offended im straight, but this was kinda like family guy humor, i saw it in theatres too and im gonna buy it when its released in 7 days :P boondock saints ftw"

Me too!"
,random-critic,2010-03-08T16:18Z,"LMAO!!!!!

Bohr999
You gave the move a 10/10 with A: 8 V:8
Then you said don't download???

Everyone should grab this.

In all fairness it would be more like A:9 V:9.
After watching several times separately and with other people I could give the movie a 9/10. Several comedic scenes but only if you're in to their strange humour.


summary: 9/9/9"
,Chr157,2010-03-09T05:09Z,"@random-critic 
Bohr999 gave it a -10.
Just get off your high horse and let people speak how they feel about a movie. In other words, leave your opinion and STFU."

,maple_leaf,2010-03-19T11:47Z,"I guess i should me mad at myself for having such high expectations for this movie. But in my opinion, it sucked as a sequel to the first movie. I was really dissapointed. How could this happen with the same cast, same director and the SAME writers? 
Not all that bad though, it probably would've been alot better if i hadnt seen the first movie :/"

Has nothing on the 1st, but looking forward to the 3rd! av 10/10....I was wondering if you could PLEASE upload another Norman Reedus film called Tough Luck from 2003. Been searching everywhere for it, to no avail. I've been dl'ing from you for quite a while and you're torrents are amazing. If there is ANY hope for finding this movie, I know you'd be the one to get it! Thanks!!"
