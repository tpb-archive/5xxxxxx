Except The Making of you can find these videos everywhere but I wanted to create a DVD video to compile them all into a single disk so with the pass of time I could remember all this information easily. This DVD is also my personal tribute to Bioware for creating such an impressive universe that mantains captivating me since I first played Mass Effect.

I hope this DVD tempt you enough to buy the game and join the Mass Effect community. 

Be patient while I'm seeding this...my DSL speed connection sucks big time and its been ages since I upload something in TPB. So any suggestion to help me improve seeding is welcome. Thanks for the patience. 
This time I decided to leave at it is only RAR it to be only a file a little more compressed.
