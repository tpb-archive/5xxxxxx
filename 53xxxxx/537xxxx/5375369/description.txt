/* ***************************************************************************** */

From traditional statistical analysis of variance and predictive modeling to exact methods and statistical visualization techniques, SAS software is designed for both specialized and enterprisewide analytical needs. SAS software provides a complete, comprehensive set of tools that can meet the data analysis needs of the entire organization.

Credit goes to J (oil99) for gathering up the bits and pieces of SAS 9.1.3 torrents out there, and MakoShark2 for creating the patch to get it all working. I used ThinApp 4.0.4 to wrap up an installation as a portable app (i.e. it's a single executable--no need to install--just download and run) that should work on most setups (although 9.1.3 does not work on 64-bit systems). If it doesn't work for you, make sure your system meets the minimum requirements, and update your Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

The patch forces in a date within the (now long expired) licence period. Note that this means that date() and datetime() functions {eg. today()} will return the *forced* date. Instead, use the macro &SYSDATE which stores the CORRECT date returned by the system (assuming you start a new SAS session each day).

If this torrent works well for you, please leave a comment to let others know. Thanks.
