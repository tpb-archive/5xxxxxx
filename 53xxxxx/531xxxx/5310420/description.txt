Product Description:
Wario returns to his roots! The Wario Land series is where Wario first appeared, and it's back in all its side-scrolling, platform-jumping glory! Shake it! With the Wii Remote turned sideways, veterans and newcomers alike can run, jump, and smash their way through hectic sidescrolling stages. By shaking the Wii Remote, you can shake down your enemies, free coins from treasure bags, and even cause earthquakes! Explore, Fight, Plunder! Each stage is a masterfully crafted side-scrolling obstacle course of puzzles, enemies, and assorted hazards. Every stage holds numerous secrets and treasures to discover (and steal). And each stage has multiple "missions" to keep you coming back again and again to unlock everything, collect more coins, or just improve your best time! Wario is back, baby! Wario returns to form, with all the jumping, power-dashing, and butt-stomping we've come to expect! This is Wario at his finest!
