This story opens in 1938 in Rome, where Marcello has just taken a job
working for Mussollini and is courting a beautiful young woman who will
make him even more of a conformist. Marcello is going to Paris on his
honeymoon and his bosses have an assignment for him there. Look up an
old professor who fled Italy when the fascists came into power. At the
border of Italy and France, where Marcello and his bride have to change
trains, his bosses give him a gun with a silencer. In a flashback to 1917,
we learn why sex and violence are linked in Marcello's mind
