Description:

Now for the PSPÂ® (PlayStationÂ®Portable) system, flOw is a game about piloting an aquatic organism through a surreal biosphere where players consume other organisms, evolve, and dive into the abyss.

With an embedded design of DDA (dynamic difficulty adjustment), players with differing skill levels can intuitively customize their game experience and enjoy the game at their own pace.

You can play as one of 5 creatures, each in a unique environment. Use the analog stick for an organic experience that will allow you to glide, flit, and flOw through the universe.
