
WELCOME TO WISEFOOL PRESS. We are pleased to announce the MMX Editions of The Enlightenment Trilogy. These books have undergone minor revisions and each contains Bonus Material. A fourth book, Jed McKenna's Notebook: All Bonus Content from The Enlightenment Trilogy, is also available. 

In the eight years that we have been publishing Jed's books, they have developed a loyal readership and achieved the status of underground classics. They have sold over 100,000 copies in more than fifty countries, and have been translated by publishers in Europe and Asia. 

Jed's books are a joy to read. They're full of charm and humor, memorable characters and delightful dialogues. They're also full of something seldom found in "spiritual" books; a stark and unyielding challenge to the reader. In the end, these books are about one thing â€” moving beyond the ego â€” and that's a territory many wish to leave unexplored. 

Jed's books are not all sweetness and light, and they're not for everyone. 

The tagline of the Enlightenment Trilogy is "The Search Is Over". We have good reason for saying that. Some readers have called these the last spiritual books anyone will ever need, and there's good reason for saying that too. Jed McKenna's books are required reading for anyone who is not afraid to go where honest inquiry leads, and no one who is serious about their spirituality can afford not to read them. 

The bottom line is that spirituality has a bottom line, and Jed shows us right where it is.
