Battlefield: Bad Company 2 brings the award-winning Battlefield gameplay to
the forefront of PC gaming with best-in-class vehicular combat and unexpected
Battlefield moments. New vehicles like the ATV and a transport helicopter
allow for all-new multiplayer tactics on the Battlefield. With the
Frostbite-enabled Destruction 2.0 system, you can take down entire buildings
and create your own fire points by blasting holes through cover. You can also
compete in four-player teams in two squad-only game modes, fighting together
to unlock exclusive awards and achievements. Battles are set across expansive
maps, each with a different tactical focus. The game also sees the return of
the B Company squad in a more mature single-player campaign.
