Show Description:

The Legend of Mythica is simply the most spectacular parade ever conceived and executed at a Disney theme park.


The whole crux of Legend of Mythica is that creatures of fantasy really did exist in the ancient worlds. Man and mythology shared the same space. Steven and his creative team have opted for drums as a metaphor for this symbiotic relationship. The animals would come and dance with man as they played their drums. However man became divided and argued what rhythm to play and so the drumming stopped. Without the rhythm the creatures returned to the ocean until mankind could come together to restore the harmony and inspire the return of the rhythm to call them from their watery home once more.

The show unfolds with the Key, a giant performance platform, nestling in the center of the lagoon. The Diamond Goddess is lifted into the sky to narrate our story as five mythology boats arrive into Mediterranean Harbor. Filled with performers the boats conceal six classic Disney characters. Each is revealed in turn as a particular Spirit to help us bring back rhythm to the world and encourage the return of the beasts. Goofy represents the Spirit of Laughter, Minnie is the enduring Spirit of Love, Donald reflects the courageous Spirit of Adventure, PlutoÃƒÂ¯ Â¿ Â½s loyalty and sincerity to Mickey is another strength reflected and those rascally chipmunks symbolize the Spirit of Friendship. Finally Mickey rises from the center of the Key on a winged lion to represent the never-ending Spirit of Imagination.

The mythology boats dock along the coast of Porto Paradiso and the performers engage in a land show featuring giant danceable drums. Complex Michael Curry puppets are revealed from the drums to represent the return of the mythological creatures. Five further gem goddesses are elevated above the lagoon from the eggs on the back of the boats and together they reopen the gateway to Mythica.

As the siren voices reach their crescendo four gigantic articulated imperial barges appear from the marina. These boats are seventy feet long and the Audio-Animatronic figures residing on the barges are so tall that they have to articulate down to get under the bridge. The three-headed sea hydra sways from side to side with Poseidon ruling the crows nest, the unicorn rises up on its hind legs, the phoenix ascends from its fiery pit with bursts of flames and the dragon holds a crystal ball on its hand whilst projecting fire from its nostrils. The imperial barges circle the Key with the mythology boats as the show reaches its climax.

The visual eye candy is unlike anything ever seen in a Disney production. The detailing is incredible. You can watch the show from multiple locations around the lagoon and experience a different show. The score by Alan Silvestri (with songs produced by Glen Ballard) is the finest ever written for a Disney parade or show with soaring lyrics set to majestic music (yes, it is more compelling that Illuminations: Reflections of Earth). This show is all about pomp and pageantry and it the first time that an appropriately-scaled show has featured on the lagoon at TDS. The size and scope is unlike anything to ever grace a Disney theme park. The choreography is energetic and engaging whilst the costumes are vibrant and colourful representations of the mythological beasts. The performance never sags as it conveys its story. In short it is the finest example of Disney creativity. Legend of Mythica is almost flawless. The only disappointment is the decision by the parkÃƒÂ¯ Â¿ Â½s owners, Oriental Land Company, to force the fifth anniversary song by MISIA called Sea of Dreams into the finale which deflates the conclusion as the song is incredibly treacly and overly emotional. We can only hope that Silvestri has another magic number to insert when the fifth anniversary concludes next summer.

Congratulations to the entire Disney Creative Entertainment team for having the courage of their convictions to run with a non-character based show for such an important event and to create a show that does not pander to children and dumb down the entertainment to adults. Legend of Mythica is presented daily but there are hopes that the show will eventually run twice daily enabling the spectacle to be performed at night sandwiched by BraviSEAmo. I finally found a reason to truly love TDS. And with The Snow Queen with original music by Alan Menken and lyrics by Glen Slater due to debut next July the entertainment at the Tokyo Disney Resort is finally reflecting something other than trite and infantile character shows.
