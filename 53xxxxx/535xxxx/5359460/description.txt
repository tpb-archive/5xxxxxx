Storyline:

Welcome to Wolf Creek, where the suspense of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT meets the horror of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.
Inspired by Australia's "Backpack Killer"who murdered seven backpackers in the '90s.
Wolf Creek won wide acclaim from critics, filmmakers and audience members alike at the Sundance Film Festival.

Three unsuspecting hikers take off for a drive across Australia. When the trio returns from a four hour hike to Wolf Creek National Park, they find there car is dead.
Help comes in the form of big, back-slapping bushman Mick (John Jerratt).
Since Mick appears to be more CROCODILE DUNDEE then Freddy Krueger, the trio trusts him...which proves to be a grave mistake.
