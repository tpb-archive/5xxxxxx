Spencer Christian is in love with Jacquette, but she chooses to have a sexual experience with an athlete instead. Afterwards, the athlete visits Jacquette's African American female friend to have sex with her as well. While practicing self pleasuring, Spencer Christian runs across an ad for a hypnotherapist who boosts her clients' confidence. The hypnotherapist quickly hypnotizes him but it turns out she uses this to take sexual advantage of him. Meanwhile, Spencer Christian's African American athlete friend comes over to Jacquette's apartment to talk on Spencer Christian's behalf. Alas, after offering him a drink, Jacquette just ducks down and launches at his pants and he complies. Later on, just before the moment of his climax, the hypnotherapist boosts confidence with women in Spencer Christian and then releases him from the trance. Spencer Christian later uses the same hypnosis on both Jacquette and her African American female friend. He enjoys both of them at the same time, only to be caught in them endlessly mounting him as he doesn't manage to release them from the trance.
