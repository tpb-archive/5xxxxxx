DRM will die but we all need to help to kill it I mean ALL, legit users too. If you buy games from ubisoft and others who want to make more money it means that you want in future to be dependent to them so it means if they want then you play if they dont want you to play then you cant play. When their servers will have malfunction then guess what.... YOU CANT PLAY if your internet connection fails then GUESS WHAT? yes YOU CANT PLAY !!!! legit users dont be stupid because you will be hurt in first place! They cant fight with piracy by harming legit users! But they doing IT ! Pirates will not get hurt in this fight... HMMMM piracy sounds bad ? but its NOT in all cases. Many users want to do TEST DRIVE on game and decide if game is worth it or not. If game got many bugs and crashes a lot then I dont want to lose money and my nerves on bad product so we get scene release, test it and decide if we want this or not. If yes then we buy it if not we delete it. And its not PIRACY its legal if you not using it to long... I thing in many countries its not illegal to have ""scene release"" Im not sure but its 24 hours... I may be wrong. Anyways I will not buy game until I test it and demos are in many cases to short or not convincing.

DRM is bad for legit users

isnt that the point of Demos? there is a lot of places where you can downlaod the settlers 7 demo, it gives you a feel of the game and a chance to see if the control and gameplay is to your liking.....

dont throw about 'I need to illegally download it to test it before I buy it' - If it was a console that you can't get demos for i.e. the Nintendo DS then fair enough, but there is a PC demo for almost every major PC game created.

Play the demo, Like it = buy it."

Remember the times when game was 700 mb and demo 10 - 40 mb? :) And demos are enough to see if the game will run. And what the game is about.

,pether,2010-04-02T13:28Z,"Piracy isnt stealing. Piracy is piracy. Stealing means they lose out on something. Stealing is when you take something, say, a car, then the person you stole it from doesnt have the car anymore. Piracy is when you instead copy the car, the person still has the car, only thing is that you got it too.


Piracy doesnt hurt anyone, and is only beneficial to everyone. This according to every study there is. Oh, not the studies made by or paid by the companies themselves, but normal people(maybe not people from the us as they are not thought critical thinking) dismiss those studies right away."

What Ubisoft is doing is taking a piss at free marketing. They refuse to conform to the market. They try to control it.
I support the idea of boycotting them.

The games which legit users buy are the multiplayer games. The ones with internet multiplayer, and no decent pirate ever argued they have the right to take part of that.
It's about the single player campaign and perhaps a local network.
It's when a game like that is great pirates actually buy something.

,mediafriend,2010-04-03T20:15Z,"@pether 

The idea that piracy is only beneficial is to be blunt, fucking retarded. I love piracy I think it makes the internet great. But the idea that there are no consequences is fucking insanely stupid. 

You do realize that for every one of us who downloads a game and never buy it, the company does not make money. I'm not going to jump on their bandwagon and say they are losing money, because I know pirates are pirates and they will always pirate. You're not losing money because you were never going to get it in the first place (i think it's arrogant of them to assume just because we downloaded their game, we would have bought it)

But the fact is they don't make as much money, and in some cases they make very little money and the studios get fucked.

Think about it, would you do your job for free? No. You wouldn't. You may not understand that creating a  video game actually takes work, pain and sweat but it does. They have a right to their money. 

A combination of piracy and stores like GameStop and Ebay are killing the gaming industry. You do realize that nobody who buys used games is contributing to the companies that make those games don't you? I mean last time you sold a game on ebay, did you send EA their cut? No you didnt. Says right on it that it's not for resale but everyone still does it. I love cheap games but by buying them we're driving up the cost of new games and ruining the chances of our favorite series going on into the future.

I've owned and downloaded every TOTAL WAR game, and a bunch more, if a game is good then I'll pay to play it, and happily. But if it's something I've never heard of I'll try it via download first. 

Piracy is awesome. It's still stealing. Stealing is awesome and it's still a crime. Never steal from individuals!

Also, what is the point in downloading this if it doesnt work?"
,mediafriend,2010-04-03T20:17Z,"I'm pretty sure the fact that the game is connected to the internet while being played does not earn them any more money.

,djME27,2010-04-04T09:54Z,"@mediafriend/sammywammy/anyone else:
I agree with your overall argument that piracy is not 100% positive for the gaming industry, and will second the notion that anyone who says so is calling their credibility into question (pirates who can't, or won't, argue our position fairly and logically only strengthen the image of the ""thief in denial"" that much of the uninformed public holds of us).  People who DON'T pirate, in general (middle-aged and up, non-gamers, the casual computer user) are the ones who are going to actually have their opinions heard; if ANYONE can change anything... it's them.  Think about it.  When public opinion is that we are all dirty thieves, that makes us the bad guys, regardless of how stubborn we are.  Our voices are seen as simply the voices of those who want to keep getting our games/software/movies/music for free; this is what happens when we make stubborn comments like ""There is NOTHING wrong with piracy, and in fact it is COMPLETELY beneficial and without detriment to the industry.""  A comment like this is all it takes for average Joe Regular, with his two kids, suburban life, and stock-options, to draw the conclusion that we are all bratty kids in denial of our greed.  Since he doesn't have a lot of spare time, ""Joe Regular"" does what most people do in a situation they are not personally invested in: he draws a quick conclusion based on the info he has, and without much (if any) investigation, his opinion is now more or less set.  All I can say is... its hard as hell to change Joe's mind once its made (he views being proven wrong in his beliefs is synonymous with failure, therefore he meets opposing viewpoints with initial resistance from now on). When we bitch and moan every time we can't get something right away for free; blaming everyone else while conveniently painting self-portraits of ""We the Righteous"" (arr!) doing battle with the unholy and corrupt... we get a world full of ""Joe Regulars.""  And lets face it, if we want to win this ""war,"" its those unassuming, uninterested, and quick-to-judge folks that are our best allies.  We have a lot of valid and intelligent points to make that support piracy; but given the nature of our argument, we have to be really careful how we go about presenting them.  Which is a problem, since there ARE a bunch of idiots on our side who run around spouting their bullshit on forums EVERYWHERE... and that brings us to the state of ""us against the world"" that we are in now.  Since our ""voice"" doesn't have the luxury of being affiliated with an official organization or source, it can't really be filtered, so irony is that piracy's biggest tag-teaming enemy is: The Industry... and its own personal horde of obnoxiously loud pirate minions. 
OK. Enough preaching.  I DID have some points to think about regarding a few things mediafriend mentioned:
@mediafriend: You stated ""You do realize that for every one of us who downloads a game and never buy it, the company does not make money.""  
As I was reading this line, and the following paragraph, my mind instantly locked on to an argument I have used so much I should have it in a hotkey, but once you went into detail I jumped off the defensive.  As you said, ""it is presumptious to assume we would have bought the game just because we stole it."" I would like to take it a bit further though. Your serious gamer has certain games he will simply buy, due to online benefits, features, non-glitchyness when dealing with cracks, etc.  Think about it... before piracy, those were the ONLY games I EVER bought, because they were so good I had to have it.  If I didn't have to have it, I didn't buy it, because I was a broke kid or it simply wasn't worth the money.  I'd wager to say, since kids/young adults are the majority of the market, that it goes the same for most others, both casual and serious gamers.  So, what is piracy doing?  Sure, there is a percentage that will download a game that they would have bought, and potential revenue would be lost... but at the same time, filesharing is like free"
,djME27,2010-04-04T09:55Z,"the market with used copies once they no longer rent, therefore driving DOWN retail values, they make a deal that says Blockbuster can only transfer (x) copies of said title to previously rented for sale.  The rest get destroyed.  So, say we get 300 copies of American Gangster for rent. They say we can resell 30.  Anything beyond that literally gets destroyed when it no longer rents (I had to do it, shreds the disk... many a night I cried in the shower after murdering hundreds of perfectly good discs).  So this shows that more used copies for sale doesn't drive prices UP, in fact it drives prices DOWN, which is precisely what they don't want. Still, the ability to resell is universally available to all consumers of retail products, and these retailers all have to deal with not being able to profit from the same product more than once. Its a transfer of ownership, so its rightfully yours after purchase.  Even still, they have methods of artificially managing the demand for their product and restricting free-trade that are utilized in business-to-business transactions, like I just described. Therefore gaming/entertainment industries actually have an ADVANTAGE in this dept. over other retail manufacturers.  
Holy shite.  Longest post I've ever made, and homedude probably won't even be back to read it.  Heh... if you are out there, guy... give me a holla back just to make me live in to the illusion that I didn't just waste an hour on nothing.  Peace all, much love.

,pether,2010-04-04T12:38Z,"mediafriend: There are studies that show that it is only beneficial.

Think of piracy as the best marketing tool there is. More people are able to get the produkt, and are thus subject to buying it.

Easiest to show it with music. Artists doesnt make money by selling cd's and music, they make money by doing conserts and such.

If more people listen and know their music, wouldnt there be more people that would want to go to their concerts? The answer is YES, more and more people go to conserts.

Artists and comedians who havent sold many cd/dvds in sweden for example, only a few hundred, had outsold many many times. But according to antipiratists, they wouldnt have any consumers at all.


You do realize that by having booths in clothingstores people are just going to try on clothes without buying.

There are also studies showing that pirates buy MORE then those who doesnt pirate. When you got access to the whole market, you are subject to more products, and are thus able to spend your money more visely, and only on items you think are good.
Instead of risking buying a crappy game/movie/cd/whatever.


And they are getting their money, if they are making good games. They are breaking records all the time.

If you were doing a crappy job, do you really think that suing 13 year olds should keep you that job?



I see that you are a hater of consumer rights.
Why wouldnt i be able to sell something that i have bought?
Do you think selling you car is a bad thing if you dont give the car company another share? They have already gotten their money for the product they created.

3 I CRACK ALL MY LEGAL GAMES because I don't want to always use the CD for everything
4 DRM is the wrong way to go and sometimes there are a few of my games DO NOT WORK without these Illegal cracks.
5 Game companies should embrace the new methods of distribution, give more away for free and make the games cheaper.

Without the shops, CDs and Security. the games could be cheaper and the developer would take more of the money from purchased games.

They would make the same profit but the consumer would be better off and people would be more likely to buy the games in the first place because they would be reasonably priced.

At the moment we are mostly paying for shitty protection, useless CDs, packaging and distribution/sales etc.

Protection doesn't work, it never will and it's not the way to go.

Ubisoft's reply:
""You have probably seen rumors on the web that Assassin?s Creed II and Silent Hunter 5 have been cracked. Please know that this rumor is false and while a pirated version may seem to be complete at start up, any gamer who downloads and plays a cracked version will find that their version is not complete.""

You good sir, are a retard.

-Downloading isnt illegal, so downloading drivers which are FREE OF CHARGE ofcourse inst to. But downloading(stealing) stuff you have to pay for like games isnt allowed. Therefor your comparison between games and video card drivers is completly retarted.

-If it's pulbicly avaible your still not allowed to steal it. Pissing in a public toilet is what the damn thing is for. Takeing a dump in someones frontyard is not allowed. So what the fuck are you talking about as long as something is openly avaible the laws dont count for it.

- What does a public toilet even have to with downloading games anyway.

- When you download a game on TPB you obviously have a working internet connection. So that means you can play Ubisofts games with their DRM. So its not stupid. Your just nerd raging because you cant get your game for free. Lol fail.


"
,pether,2010-04-13T14:06Z,"MorningStorm: Hey retard.

No, it isnt illegal to download, but in many countries it is still sadly illegal to upload. A big difference. Hopefully the old consumer and culture hating politicians will die off soon.

And yet again, downloading isnt stealing, it is pirating. Have you even read the law? For stealing to be stealing, there has to be a victim that loses something real. Copying something that exists in infinite numbers isnt stealing.

Thanks, you too!
Besides, have you ever tried this DRM? If so, then you probably also know that it stinks as Ubi cant provide enough bandwidth to allow everyone that actually bought the game to log in. So MY working Internet connection has nothing to do with it, Ubi's does.

I admit, I could have used a better thing than a public toilet, but its still the same point. Downloading isn't illegal, uploading is in some countries (as pether already said).

And no, I'm not nerd raging because I can't get the game for free. In fact, if it didn't have this retarded DRM, I'd already have bought it! And as you're on TPB as well, you shouldn't complain about that, cuz you too get it for free ;)"

Well if DarkSyden doesn't come through, TPB could always use a few martyrs namely - you! And anyone else who has a legit copy. If you're not to engrossed by the game itself, and if you genuinely want to fight this drm in some way you could always help the peeps in this forum :

http://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=55968

They're trying to figure out the pair values / triggers for the game in order to make a working server emulator. Look on the bright side, if they succeed you get to play the game offline a year from now without placing any false hopes on UBI releasing an offline patch. Then again, you might agree that what UBI is doing is right from their POV and that this DRM is a necessary inconvenience in order to combat piracy.  They are after all a business, and who in their right mind would not want 100% return/profit for their investment. Do or don't, partake or defer, like EA's slogan, ""play it your way"" *rolleyes*.

Hate to admit it but UBI's cloud-copy-protection is a pretty good anti-piracy initiative. Just a little niggle but... CLOUD copy protection my ass, as if this has anything to do with cloud computing!? Nothing but jive and BS marketing buzz on UBI's part. I'll believe this is cloud copy protection when I see their games offered on Perlman's OnLive service till then they should seriously STFU."

This spat between you and DarkSyden is both ridiculous and pointless. YOU CANNOT STEAL A WORK IN PROGRESS!!!
Especially :
1)if it's software;
2)if it is open source and is FREE;
3)when it is used to circumvent copyright.

Most importantly you CANNOT STEAL A WORK IN PROGRESS!! Especially one that is in the pre-alpha stages of development. WHY??? Because it makes no sense to do so, and accomplishes nothing at present, so why bitch about it. Plagiarism is a another matter altogether and you know what? Even that accusation would be groundless at this juncture.

If DarkSyden wants to operate under the hubris that his lone efforts are the decisive factor of this outcome, LET HIM. If that is what motivates him, then let him do what he must, what he wants. Let him operate under any illusion or preconveived notion(s) if by doing so he operates under a higher level of efficacy.

This is the same shit that happened with AC2 and regardless it is now common knowledge that we have Dormine to thank for the server emu. Have a little more faith in the inquisitive nature of your fellow pir8's to sift through the muck and mire of what is and what's what.

Do not deride. Instead enforce, suggest, inform and aid in a constructive manner : all within the singular purpose of getting a working emu going. Isn't that what's important?!?! If and when one might arise, and enables partial playthrough, then go on ahead and whine about proper street creds. And when you do, enforce your anal retentive scene rules that is, be sure to bring up the one about how -={: a server emulator is not deemed a proper 'crack' and should be nuked (even if it ENABLES you to play the game) :}=-. I'm sure you'll find plenty of support there *snicker*.

I'm a gamer first and foremost, and everthing else as a forethought (like 99.99999% of the other TPB users). In short, we're pir8's. Remember : pir8's are neither morally corrupt, nor morally enlightened, we just have no morals LOL."

By making it so these games can only be played while online, you are actually pissing off paying customers.  Putting protection like this on the games is not going to stop you losing money, all you are doing is sending ppl like me, to websites like this, looking for a way to play my BOUGHT game while offline, and oh! heck, wait a minute, seeing as I am here, why don't I have a look around and see if there's some other game i might like!  Only PURE GENIUS could think of something like that!!  I DON'T have unlimited internet access per month, and I like to play pc games a LOT.  It would therefore cost me a lot more money if I had to stay online just to play them.  I don't like playing against other people online either, just like to play by myself.

It DOES fucking work, but the emulator is being made right now still so you can only do a few missions, consider it half cracked and u can play half way. The crack isn't a crack its a server emulator. This is fucking fine for DL.

I'm getting sick of the obvious fucking Ubisoft employee's aka third party posters paid by ubi spamming these fucking forums with DRM wins bullshit when it clearly fucking loses. Same fucking bs said about AC2 and I played ac2 start to finish pirated already. 

All this shit just so the fucking stock holders have something to look at and grin, but mother fuckers I'm sure edit out over 80% of the fucking comments on here.

@ nerdy 666

Now, let's see if I can phrase this ""maturely"". 

Just so you know.....Ducks do not ""yap"", they ""quack"".

Nerdy, I did not take anything personally but it seems that you did.  I did not call YOU an idiot personally, and I did not tell you seek a psychaiatrist.  

Thank you for pointing out TWICE that I irritated myself.  Once would have been enough so maybe you should read through your comments and edit them before you press the ""submit"" button.  Alternatively, it might be a good idea for you to learn some proper english grammar, spelling and punctuation.

If people would read just a few of the comments already posted on a particular torrent, they would already see whether a crack has been made without having to repeatedly ask.  All this does, is take up space and others who come along have to read through the same questions over and over to find what they are looking for, which quite frankly, irritates me.

Everyone has the right to their own opinion.  It was so nice to come here and express my feelings.

btw, other people make comments on different torrents on this site and use language like f**k, c**t, yet I post with the worst word being ""idiot"" and I get roasted!

,vergil80,2010-05-03T22:44Z,anyone knows how to resolve the lag problem?it's lagging from 10 in 10 sec
,JU5T1C3,2010-05-04T02:10Z,"People who have the lag/freeze for 10sec every 10min, this is to do with the broken autosave in the game which is apparently fixed in the 1.03 patch.

The only way to get around it is, buying the game, wating to see if a 1.03 NoCD exe comes out for the game or finding a way to disable the autosave feature in the game which I have not been able to find."
,setari,2010-05-04T05:03Z,Anyone got a trainer working for this yet? 1.02?

I downloaded a crack for AC 2 and I suddenly skipped all the parts of logging in and etc.
AC 2 was a GREAT game, and I had no problems during gameplay :)

,Mkvenner123,2011-05-15T00:52Z,There is no new crack. Razor made the 1.02 crack only. Actually I have enjoyed this game and seeing the list of changes in subsequent patches makes me want to buy this title but the awful DRM stops me.
