Shawn Michaels is one of the most charismatic and talented athletes in the history of entertainment.
For more than 20 years he has wowed crowds, earning accolades, championships and numerous
monikers, including "The Icon," "The Main Event," and "Mr. WrestleMania." Now, for the first time
ever, Shawn Michaels sits down and in an intimate interview retraces his early days in Texas through
his Rocker tag-team partnership in AWA and WWE through his multiple reigns as WWE Champion.
Shawn Michaels: My Journey offers surprising insights and absolute candor as he relives the highs
and lows of his historic career. Over 20 amazing matches from the 80s, 90s and 2000s --most available
on DVD for the very first time--demonstrate why Shawn Michaels is truly "The Showstopper."
