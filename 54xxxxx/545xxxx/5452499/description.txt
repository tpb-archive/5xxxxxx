             PDF enabled software is a vital component for every              
             desktop. PDF or Portable Document Format is a widely             
             used file format originally developed by Adobe. This             
             format is rapidly becoming the defacto standard for              
             publishing on the web.                                           
             Our pdf writer pdfMachine converts a print stream                
             from an application directly into a PDF. Once you                
             have installed the pdf writer, open your document                
             that you want to convert, then click "print", select             
             the "Broadgun pdfMachine printer" and that's it!                 
                                                                              
             The Benefits of PDF                                              
                                                                              
             * Integrity: PDF documents generated by pdfMachine,              
               when printed or viewed, maintain the integrity of              
               all formatting in the original document. PDF files             
               preserve documents formats independent of                      
               software, hardware, or operating system used to                
               generate the original file. They can be opened,                
               read and printed by many free PDF readers                      
               available on the web, and viewed on operating                  
               systems such as Windows, MacOS, and Unix variants.             
             * Technology: PDF format is the best document format             
               for long-term digital archival. Often software                 
               becomes obsolete, rendering some documents                     
               unreadable by current technology. Widely published             
               formats, such as PDF, are more future proof that               
               proprietary formats such as MS Word. In 50 years               
               time, even if PDF's are not used anymore, all you              
               need is the PDF specification and you can have a               
               viewer developed to read your documents.                       
             * Searchable: PDF has the ability to store text in a             
               searchable form.                                               
             * Browsers: PDF files can be viewed within Netscape              
               and Internet Explorer. These files can then be                 
               saved for off-line use or printed. This makes for              
               easy use within an intranet or website.                        
             * Colour and Size: PDF files enable sharp,                       
               colour-precise printing on most printers with                  
               precise onscreen colour match regardless of                    
               monitor brand. Users can magnify documents up to               
               800% without the loss of clarity in text or                    
               graphics. PDF files can be optimized and are often             
               smaller than conventional document formats.

             options and is a native Windows print driver. If you
