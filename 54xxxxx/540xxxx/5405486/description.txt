This is the first expansion pack of content for the fitness game EA Sports
Active, offering more focused and intensive core exercises to play. New to the
EA Sports Active franchise is an emphasis on abdominal exercises including
curl ups, crunch and punches, as well as a warm up/cool down feature. An all-
-new presentation brings users to the tropics and immerses them in warm
weather activities like waterskiing and paddle surfing. The product also
features the Six-Week Challenge -- another step in the journey towards better
health and fitness with new daily workouts that ramp up in intensity each
week.
