"No Justice!" "No Peace!" This rising chant from the streets
escalated in answer to the seemingly endless incidents of police
brutality throughout this great nation. Following the shooting of Amadou Diallo by 4 members of the NY City Police Department these chants rose from the streets by heartbroken and enraged voices. However, there are two sides to every story and the truth is often found where you least expect it. "If I Die Tonight" reflects on the lives and stories of those who survive on both sides of an impenetrable divide.
