plot:
Set in the New York club scene of the late 1980's thru the 1990's,a tale 
which chronicles the rise and fall of club-kid promoter Michael Alig, a party organizer, 
whose extravagant life was sent spiralling downward when he boasted on television that 
he had killed his friend, roommate, and drug dealer, Angel Melendez. Originally from Indiana,
Alig moved to New York, and came to be an underground legend, known for his excessive drug use
and outrageous behavior in the club world. At his peak, he had his own record label, and 
magazine, and hosted Disco 2000, one of the biggest club nights in New York in the '90s. He was
doing a lot of drugs, and as his addiction got worse, his party themes became darker and more 
twisted. Alig's saga reached its tragic crescendo when he viciously murdered his drug dealer, 
Angel, by injecting him with Drano and throwing him in the East River. The power he wielded on 
the club scene made him feel untouchable, so he didn't hestitate to boast of the murder. 
The press thought it was a publicity stunt--until Angel's body washed ashore.
