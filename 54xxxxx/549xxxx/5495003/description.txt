Seed notes:
- a 1.42 second dropout was removed at 2:42 of d2t06 (Weekapaug)
- levels lower and signal becomes slightly muffled at the 02:30 point of d2t08 (Ya Mar)
and continue for the duration of the show...it sounds as if an AUD patch was done here
- Memories was not present on the source discs, most likely performed acoustically
and therefore not picked up by the SBD feed
