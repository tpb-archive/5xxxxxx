    In the near future with a intergalactic vampire plague threatening       
    earth, an expedition is sent to a distant galaxy in hopes of             
    discovering the plague^s source. Landing on a mysterious planet they    
    discover that Spectrum radiation has turned the atmosphere into a        
    one-color tint. Exploring further, the group discovers living            
    dinosaurs, a race of vampire cavemen, and other strange creatures.
