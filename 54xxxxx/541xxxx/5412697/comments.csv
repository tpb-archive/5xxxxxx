In order to do this though you need to add the savr game to the numbers folder and you canonly play on one map. You can get a feel for the game and see if your computer can handle it though which is a good thing.

One thing that I noticed though.... Are the graphics in this game WORSE tyhan in the first one??? I mean the first one SUCKED for the computer because of all the lag it just wasn't optimized well, but in this one I have NO lag but it seems that the reason for this is that they did the grapghics MUCH different in this game."

You dont delete the actual save game from the folder, you delete the save in game, if you dont it will keep syncronising with the save already registered at ubisoft.
So step by step:

1. Start a new game
2. white screen appears, exit game then reenter
3. Go in to the history and choose to delete your current save
4. Go back out to the folder, check if file has been deleted, if not do so (there may be another folder named deleted saves, I just deleted that one too)
5. Copy paste the downloaded save in to the folder
6. Voila!

Thank you thank you I know im good"
,ubiHardz,2010-03-10T17:41Z,himkimos save games work but cannot do mission ok mogrosh..just can free roam without do any MISSION. 
,Mogrosh,2010-03-10T18:24Z,"@ubiHardz
You might be correct. none of himkimos saves lets you start from the beginning, so I didnt even try to go for a mission. Decided to wait till I could find one from the start

@P0nutz
You might have to reinstall the game and try again"
,bLoWsMokE,2010-03-10T19:19Z,"Yes well I ended up saying fuck it and just buying the fuckin game and one the back of the cover it says ""Saved games are syncronized online"" I think that pretty much spells out why ou get a white screen

It seems that even though you have the saved gam on your hard disk... when it tries to load a new mission the hard disk saved games have nothing to sync up to therefore inducing a white screen where there should be action.

Great game so far though.... Graphics aren't what you'd expect though, I actually found that the graphics in this are worse than in he first one. I think this is because in this one the game requires MUCH more of a population than the first game.

The fighting is AWESOME!!! More video gamish though and not as realistic as the first one. Not the graphics but in how fast the swings are etc it's hard to expla9in but once you play you will see.

Another great thing is that you have a MUCH better hand to hand experience.

AND NO EZIO is NOT missing his ring finger but it's not as bad as it seems because they bring this up in the game and give a reason for it so it's not just an oversight ubisoft made.

I say this because I have heard people complain that ubisoft forgot to take his ring finger off but they didn't.

One more thing I LOVE about this game is that you can change the colors of Ezios robes. One thing I never made sense of is how altair had such an uncommon robe on yet noone noticed who he was even after chasing him. In this game you can change the color of your robes and I have them black right now which makes Ezio blend in MUCH better.

There IS still a lag issue the way the first one had the lag issue when in a bigger city. My computer is over the recommended specs etc so I hope they patch it with a fix for that.

Don't get me wrong though the game is optimized MUCH better than the first one was.

In this one though you get a sense of Prince of Persia graphics..... Hard to explain...."
,skinny_gorilla,2010-03-10T22:01Z,"Fully agree with bLoWsMokE. Its better to buy this fuckin game(bloody 20euro). Pretty extreme solution but crack wont be here for a very long time!!!

Id say that graphics are little bit worse than in the first one but they are not similar to Prince of Persia. Short mission in catacombs and the one inside the cathedral(where you look for assassins seals) are very alike Prince of Persia or Thumb Rider Underworld. Lots of tricks and some stupid riddles to solve. Thats the only similarity for me.

Anyway, Game is great. Combat is really impressive. One wouldn't realize there is so many ways to kill someone.
Horse riding is really cool as well. They fixed muscle movement. Horse looks dynamic and real. Only Ezio himself should be better 
animated. Altair was smoother and running wasn't so stupid looking...

Good luck with crack to everyone..."
,kiliaan,2010-03-10T22:13Z,"bLoWsMokE and others who have the real game:

Saved games are synchronized with your machine. Even if u store them on your hard drive you still have 2 be online to play the game. That means that server is going to check your saves every time.

Basically, you will need a crack that will give you fake identification or maybe would be bater to create special server for cracked games... :)

,chilkot,2010-03-11T03:52Z,"DEFINITIVE WORKING FIX FOR ANIMUS WHITE SCREEN BUG: 

Alright, i've figured it out. After cracking as instructed, open the launcher, and press the little gear icon. This will ask you if you want to disable the syncing of save files, which resets and resyncs the ones back to you. This is the problem. After disabling this, close the launcher, and copy the himkimos save files ( fromrapid
share.
com
/files/361410314/MyOwnSavesAC2.rar)
Using the instructions in the crack folder for the animus fix, copy in ONLY THE FIRST FOUR SAVES AND THEIR META FILES in to the folder.

,Mogrosh,2010-03-11T16:10Z,The crack is working as intended. This prevents you from having a serial Key. Crack is not a save game which is the reason why this game is not wokring yet

@Yorien The DRM was completely removed. The game starts without internet connection and all. But there are triggers and gamecode on the server side. They unlock as you play along.

A comment from an angry player in the ubisoft forums, looks like a working crack will be out very soon since the DRM servers went down for good.

,bLoWsMokE,2010-03-11T19:22Z,"You know guys I was just thinking. Now I bought AC2 I liove in USA and have no problems with the DRM servers not letting me play. Ib guess this problem is moreso with UK and European players, BUT what I was thinking is... how long will they keep these servers running constantly? I mean I have games that are over 8 years old that I still play.... will this DRM server of theirs still be up and functional in 5 years from now.... 2 years from now??? Are they going to have a team of people constantly upkeeping this DRM server for this one game.

PYou would think NO they will start doing this with all their games but that cannot be because with JUST AC 2 their servers are crashing... imagine adding another game to that platform the server won't start up LOL.... PLUS I HIGHLY doubt they will ever attempt this shit again seeing as how it was one of the worst ideas any game developer as ever come up with.

I don't understand their logic!!! They say to themselves... OK if we make it so that NO piraters can get this game for free then more people will buy the game!

Ok heres the problem I bet that a majority of piraters don't buy their games because they canot afford it... hen there are a LOT who pirate the game and if they like it buy it (UBI will lose some of those buyers NOT gain more), another thing is that thge people who were going to buy thge game was going to buy it and not pirate it ANYWAY therefore there is no iuncrease of sales there either.

Another thing is that the people who WOULD have pirated the game will not be able to and Ubi will lose their good word of mouth thus reducing sales further. People who have a computer JUST to play game who have no internet connection will also NOT buy this game thus reducing sales further. Some people will just not buy their game at all because they think this new DRM plan of theirs is RETARDED!!! Therefore reducing sales even further.

NOW people are complaining that they cannot even play the game they bought which will result in people WANTING THEIR MONEY BACK, AND to just not buy the game at all out of fear it won't work AGAIN reducing sales further.

I don't understand why they did this.... What logic did thy use to come to the conclusion that this will increase sales... because I will almost GUARANTEE that they will LOSE MUCH MUCH MUCH more sales then they gain..

Let's just hope Ubi realizes how big of a mistake they made and come out with a patch which allows you to save an load without your saves being synchronized online.

OOOHHH UBISOFT you've really done it this time. 

OH one other thing... I think the patch that they have for the game makes it run worse LOL. Shit I can get GTA IV to run better on my computer than AC2. I really think it's got to do with that patch because when I dled the game from pirate bay and got to free run   had NO lag but then I bought the game ind installed the patch and there it is LAG... it's either the patch or their stupid online requirement which is proly not the reason for it only needs to be online at the change of scenes.

I believe this CAN be cracked but the amount of work it will take to crack it is IMMENSE. I mean you need to be syched online after you start a mission end a mission move to anothr village buy things at stores, basically whenever the game needs to load and sometimes when it doesn't and eery single spot where thiere is a load screen will have to be reconfigured to store on the hard disk or however they do it so the cracking of AC2 will be EXTREMELY tedious and will not be done for a LONG time unless there are teams of people cracking one game it will STILL take AT LEAST two week of non stop configuring."

They have commented on this, if they ever do decide to take those servers down, they have a fix (patch) available to use to make any such affected games playable again without the connection to their DRM. 

So you won't be completely fucked, if they're decent enough to release it in such a case, that is. "

for the these games in the future! So our bought games become OBSOLETE, because we 
need to be able to connect to servers that are long dead! Or what if I dont have 
internet for example. Freakin UBISOFT. DO not FUKIN buy games from them. The games 
will turn OBSOLETE in the future. DO not support them no matter what. Your games are 
only for some years, and your children will never be able to use them. YOUR GAMES WILL NOT LAST."
,MonsterC,2010-03-12T19:13Z,"Like guys after reading some of the earlier comments I just decided to make an account on TPB to say something I've got on my mind for a long time now. 

Most of you people are just ARGH.
I mean Razor1911, RELOADED,SkiDROW, ViTALY, etc. They are all working very hard and all we can do is whine about how bad we want to have a crack. When you go to Razor1911's facebook there are a million comments saying ""RAZOR CRACK PLEASE GIVE ME A CRACK I NEED IT!"" that just pisses me off. Its a Miracle that ""The Scene"" is still giving us these cracks. We are un-thankful or however you spell it, im not from an english speaking country so forgive my grammar. Instead of whining go make your own crack, try it. Give it some effort. That's what I am doing. I want this just as much as you guys, but show some more respect to The Scene. I'm sure they are working very hard so just stop your fucking whining about ""GIVE ME A CRACK NOW"". I mean be glad they are still making them for US ( though mostly for themselves I think...for fun/education/w/e.) 

"
,thyagus,2010-03-12T19:18Z,"Lol, by the time that the games become obsolete they're for sure cracked, and if not probably companies themselves issue offline patchs...

So, that's another argument that people use just because they've been owned by Ubi lol :P

And no, I don't have the original game and I'm pretty anxious for a crack too."
,thyagus,2010-03-12T19:25Z,"I remember the excuse being ""What?! I have to have the CD/DVD on my drive while playing? OMG! I'm gonna download and use a crack instead!! Down with the system!!""

FFS...People just want the game for free, everyone knows it. Face it and quit the bullshit about not buying the original because X or Y when you never though of buying it in the first place.

If the game was 20/30? I would buy it, more than that no. Even if I'm waiting for ACII since I started to play the first one..."
,bLoWsMokE,2010-03-12T19:31Z,"Greenpakto, you hit the nail on the head. I wrote a comment similar to that yesterday saying MAN do you people REALLY think that they are going to keep this server that runs ONE game up for more than 5 years. You guys think they are going to pay a team to upkeep a server that is only for one game.

I know it will be only for one game because IF they try this again with otgher games they will HAVE tyo set up a different server separate from the one for AC2 because the AC2 servers are crashing like crazy in the UK and Europe and this is only from one game... imagine putting two games on that one server and all the people trying to connect at the same time... theres no way man.

I been saying this for days now... UBISOFT WILL REGRET DOING THIS!!!

There is no logic behind it... if you really think about you will realize that by doing this they will LOSE MANY more sales than they gain. For one because the people who were going to buy the game are going to buy it ANYWAY and the people that pirate the games usually won't uy the game because they don't have the money to spend on a ideo game and RIGHT THERE they lose sales because some of the people that were going to buy thge game anyway will say HELL no to it because of the online requirement that NOBODY likes!!!

Shit what if I go on a road trip and bring my desktop computer....... like a road trip in one of those camping trailors that have a kitchen etc I won't be able to play this game??? That's BULLSHIT... They try to pretty it up by saying... oh this will allow you to play without a CD (which I do with games that I've bought ANYWAY because I end up DLing the crack after a while the CD gets scratched ANYWAY) and you have unlimited install capability which is actually pretty cool. It's the ONLY up side to it.

I don't know what went through Ubisoft minds when they wqere thinking ""if we stop people from pirating our games we will make more sales"" because on the outside it seems logical but when you actually get down to it and think about the impact it will have on the gaming community you will realize that they will LOSE MUCH more sales than they will gain... Sorry for being repetetive but I ca't help it... I am SOOO worked up over this shit..."

For those of you who are asking for the ""Product Key"", you do not need it, if you have copied the Crack game files in the game folder, and the Crack launcher file in its folder, when you click okay for the product key (leave it blank), it will start the game.

The problem right now is with the loading ""White Animus Screen"", which happens once the game has already started and Desmond is using the Animus for the very first time in Assassin Creed 2. If anyone has crossed this obstacle then please enlighten us with your method. Thank you."

,rugburn11,2010-03-15T19:27Z,"Danish to English translation...

Hello boys.

So I got a little further in the game.

Have messed with it in 4 hours and here's what I did.

1. Start the game
2. If you have a profile and had the game started, but only come to the table where everything is so white, so you walk out of the game. You've had a SAVE in STORAGE folder, it is important that you have had the game started. !
3. DELETE now your profile in the game, my name Desmond. Once you've done it, so shut the game down.
4. Download now Animus BUG FIX 2 from here: http://wiaderko.net/da/gry-komputerowe/53776-% 5Blangtitle% 3Den% 5Dassassins-creed-ii-CloneDVD-multi9-white-screen-bug-fixed-% 25100 -- working-% 5B% 5D.html long title
5. Now open C: \ Program Files \ Ubisoft \ Ubisoft Game Launcher \ storage.
6. Equal now TEMP folder you downloaded into storage.
7. The Downloader is also a folder called dW1lcmY, open it.
8. Copy the folder ""4"" and ""Deleted"" folder into your own VOLAPÜK folder in storage.
9. Start the game and should have a new profile in your game by the name of Desmond and a new Spawn place in the game.
10. Good luck. It is successful for me."

Ubisoft will realize that making their games easier accessible and at a sensible price has a much greater chance at beating piracy. If it weren't for the full retail price, I'd buy it. "
,cwc3,2010-03-17T09:29Z,"Got game today from friend, but traded key already.

Here is how I got it to work.
______________________________________

1) Install game with disabled network connection
2) Move crack over to both directories
3) Enable Connection. When you launch the game, it will try updating. I Canceled update for now.
4) When you open the game, the Ubisoft Launcher tries updating, couldn't stop that.

When its done, create an account and then exit. Copy the game launcher crack back over again. (Since before version got patched)

This time I was able to click OK and go through.

Random things I also did, just in-case above doesn't work.  (I doubt these will help)

Set AssassinsCreedIIGame to Win XP SP2 Compat. Mode.
Tried a few times getting past OK with just a single number.

its not about buying the game,most of the time when i like a game i bought it.
but know company like UBI or EA think they can milk us for money with shity product.

last game i bought was ME2: bugs everywhere,server down for 15hours,graphix are horrible sometime....i'm not going to do the same mistake for this game,either way they take down the DRM,or i'm going to wait for a crack and buy the game when it become an oldi at 10?.

hell isaw shop like FNAC in france that still have the supprem collector box,prof that no one want this game for now,at least not reall gamer.

I bought the game and I am still angry about it and I still come on pirates bay everyday waiting for a crack...

I have been anticipating this method of eliminating piracy knowing full well that it may never happen because the idea itself is VERY bad. Even though it WILL eliminate piracy of this game it also eliminates the word of mouth from pirates it will eliminate the pirates  that pirate the game and then buy it after knowing if they like it, it increases bad word of mouth it decreases sales of the people that were already going to buy the game but now won't because of this silly DRM it also reduces sales from the people who were going to buy the game but now won't on principle.. it reduces the amount of sales from people who would have bought the game but now won't from fear of Ubisofts server going down it reduces the sales from the people who were going to buy the game but now won't because they only use there computers for games and not internet. it will also reduce the sales from people who were going to buy the game bbut now won't because they own a gamin laptop and like to play on the go.

Whqat did they thin??? that by using this DRM the people that were gong to pirate the game will now buy it instead.....??? Well that is certainly true in SOME cases but not likely for most for the point of pirating is to save money that one does not have therefor not being able to buy the game even if they wanted to and the sales they will gain from this does not even come close to countering the loss of sales they will have because of this DRM and all of the aforementioned shit I brought up."

,BubonicChronic,2010-03-20T22:48Z,"PLEASE READ THIS.  I have read through all of everyone comments and the majority of people say that this crack doesnt work.  The crack does indeed work and here is how.

Download the torrent.
Mount image and install the game.
Then drop in the Assassins creed 2 cracks to the install folder.
run the updater and setup a ubisoft account
drop the ubisoft crack into the ubisoft install folder
launch the game, when it comes up and asks you to input the cd key just hit ok.
It will then move to a screen that says that game will start in 5 seconds.  At this point you need to look at the top right of the window and click on the gear icon which asks you if you would like to put your game saves online.  Of course click no and the game will launch.  Its a pain but it does indeed work.  You do although have to be online to make this happen.

@MorningStorm

I understand your logic and sarcasm, what i don't understand, what is it doing here on a torrent page of Piratebay. Either your a sadist who pries on other ppls desperation or you are one of us who is also waiting for a crack but has gone into denial to cope with the frustration.

BTW, you owe me a Psychotherapy fee :D

Hang in there mates, it will happen.

Ofcourse Im here to download stuff, but when something comes out that can't be cracked I'm not gonna whine about it. I take it for granted, Ill play one of the other 1000's of games that -are- cracked. I just laugh at people freaking out because they think the have the RIGHT to get this stuff free. The dont. So dont act like it and enjoy that you can actually take this stuff without haveing the right to it.

So ill pass on that pshych test, thank you very much ;)"

Stop Complaining about Ubisoft,

The longer it takes for a universal crack to be made, the more stupid people have to buy it. What means that the company gets more money, what makes investors put more money & effort into the next game --> What means that smart people can play better games for free.

At least I have no problems with DRM, my brother somehow copied the little files Ubisoft replied when a friend played the game. He made a strange linuxlike program (runs on windows) with that i have to run with a laptop that is attached to my pc (instead of the modem). :-)

Contrary to popular belief, PC game piracy is not a victimless crime. Games development is an extremely expensive, highly risky, lengthy and complex process. Major games now cost tens of millions of dollars and thousands of man hours to develop, and securing that sort of investment in the face of rampant piracy is increasingly difficult. Piracy has already skewed games development towards consoles in recent years, and has resulted in the death of PC exclusives which take full advantage of the power of the PC as a gaming platform. Even those games which are ported over to PC are typically delayed to ensure that piracy of the PC version doesn't undermine sales on the consoles, and they also exhibit signs of their console heritage.

In the face of rampant game piracy, it is now quite likely that quality single-player PC games will soon be a thing of the past, and multiplayer-focused games, especially MMOs, will become the PC's only viable niche. We have only the pirates - people who believe they are entitled to other peoples' work without contributing anything towards it - to thank for this. All the usual excuses for pirating games do not stand up to scrutiny: good games get pirated more, not less; games with demos are pirated just as much as those without; games without DRM are pirated rampantly; cheaper games are pirated just as heavily as more expensive ones; and whether a small struggling studio or a major company releases a game, the piracy rates are equally as high across the board. These facts, along with the incorrect claim that ""DRM doesn't work"", are covered thoroughly in my PC Game Piracy Examined article.

If you don't wish to accept this new form of DRM, that's perfectly understandable. The solution is simple: do not purchase Assassin's Creed 2. However do not pirate it either. There is absolutely no excuse to pirate AC2 or any other game; a game is a luxury item and not a necessity. Piracy will simply force Ubisoft and other companies to either try even more intrusive forms of DRM, or abandon the PC as a platform for major games, particularly quality single-player games.

Make no mistake, the ultimate victim of piracy is PC gaming itself. PC gamers are slowly killing the hobby they profess to enjoy. In many ways, it may already be too late. Ask yourself this: are pirated games really worth risking the continued decline of the PC as a gaming platform?


Update: Note that misinformed reports of this new DRM system being cracked are false. Any pirated versions available cannot be played without glitches, and there are confirmed reports that they are all incomplete - i.e. the game cannot be played all the way through. The details are provided here. As such the protection system has already been sufficient to prevent successful day-zero piracy of AC2.

Update 2: Recently some European players of AC2 could not connect with the authorization servers to play AC2. Ubisoft has confirmed that this temporary outage was actually a DDOS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack which lasted around 7 hours. Clearly, there are people out there who do not wish legitimate purchasers to play this game and have no qualms about inconveniencing them to supposedly make a ""point"" about this DRM."

We knew it was coming, ever since the commercial success of Blizzard's World of Warcraft. MMO-style authentic server verification for single player games was INEVITABLE. Sure EA might have screwed up with their online drm (C&C4 has been cracked) but EA's online drm is still intact. RAZOR1911, SKIDROW, RELOADED...etc have been stumped. We may see a crack in the near or immediate future or not at all. 0-day releases will be a thing of the past. Fuck 0day, we'll be lucky if you get it any other day LMAO. More devs will jump on Ubisoft's bandwagon, they might even establish a delivery service platform like steam, except where Gabe (Newell) failed, Ubisoft will succeed. I predict Eidos will implement this form of drm as well for Thi4f and Deus Ex 3. In fact any major AAA title that has a multi-million dollar budget will most likely use this harsh-draconian-restrictive YET effective drm in the foreseeable future. I don't know about you but I'm contacting my stockbroker, Ubisoft share prices will most likely rise as they become a major player in the games industry. Cai-qian!!!"

Even if people DO buy this game Ubi's sales will NOT go up in result of this DRM.

They are losing word of mouth form piraters. piraters who were going to buy the game were going to buy the game ANWYA so there no EXTRA sales there, some piaters that WOULD have bought the game but won't because they can't pirate it will mresult in loss of sales people who don't like the idea of being online to play single player won't buy the game etc etc there is so many reasons that this will REDUCE sales and any way that they will IMPROVE sales FAR underweighs all the sales they will LOSE in result of this DRM..."

Look back at the comments to see that MANY people have gotten to where they can free roam and that is the problem, you can only free roam and ity sucks... I don't even think you can fight this way but I didn't really play it long enough to find out since i have Assassins Creed one I can free roam there all I want and free roaming isn't much different in AC 2 other than Ezio is able to do a ""quick climb"" in which Altair couldn't, another thing is that Ezio and do a jump ledge grab in which Altair couldn't but you need o complete a mission in order to learn this skill, and one other thing that is different is that while you are balancing one a wire or something there are three speeds that Ezio can obtain while Altair only has two, the last difference I can think of is the spring jump which is a bar that is springy that Ezio can run onto and get sent flying across a gap he would otherwise not be able to leap,  Europe had these spring bars, the middle east did NOT apparently......

One sort of disapointment about AC2 was that Leonardo De Vince's flying machine is only used one time in the game for one mission to get over a roof that Ezio is unable to scale, then the flying machine gets busted and sinks into the water.  

There IS, however, a place you can go to after a certain level at the end of the game to use the flying machine for fun as like a side quest  without the ""quest"", it's like a side activity so there is no way to really use it for anything productive which doesn't really bother me much in itself. What bothers me about it is that the advertisements make it seem like it's part of the normal game play and it isn't......"

is the crack good?"
,TheGreenMonkey,2010-03-31T13:58Z,"Try it ""ezio123"" and tell us, maybe you will discover something we don't know because there is NO working crack righ now (will be) and NOT working means: WHITE SCREEN.
But it's never bad to give a try... :) 

Hey, can you people tell what is the problem in making crack like this? I mean, I don't understand that good how they make them but interesting... Is there something in the files that disables the loading and that something is connected to Ubisoft? and the crackers are trying to Hack it?

What is the problem to make it like that so the saves will not be checked by Ubisoft? Is that what I think RELOADED is? Like they remake the game and that's why it takes so much time?
but it comes and that's the important thing.

And another question:

The game Empire:Total War is using STEAM protection so I had to download Razor's version, is that the kind of a remake that they think to do with AC2?

as I understand there are 2 oprtions:

Remake the game or to hack it and just block the communication between the game and the defence someway...

Do we download somethink from Ubi by entering the white screen, some maps or all the required files are in the folder and they just block it? 
like, is there needed some special permission from Ubi while loading (the white screen thing) and they block it?

EXPLAIN abit if you know how it works... like, they need to make a crack that will be able to not use connection between your PC and Ubi and still the game loading can continue so there will be all the required for that? is it something like that? and is it that complicated?"

I think there will be a special presentation for us, with big painted screen and a title: ""CONGRATULATIONS, A WORKING CRACK CAME OUT TODAY"" 

so we will not miss it I think."
,Rudy_Eila,2010-04-01T02:28Z,"Actually a crack might be coming...
It is hard to crack and takes time...
The crackers will have to ""Record"" Packets that keep flowing between the net and the game  which is like recreating the game.
Then you will download these packets and instead for the game to keep downloading them you will have them in your PC and the game will think its downloading them."
,Eviden,2010-04-01T03:01Z,RAZOR 1911 says they cracked the game :

,MorningStorm,2010-04-01T12:44Z,"Maybe Ubisoft paid the hacker teams a huge sum of money to stop working on the crack.

I know what I would do when id have to choose between a lot of money or makeing some whiney bitches here happy for a few days.

,TheGreenMonkey,2010-04-01T16:31Z,"If Ubisoft had connection with the Hackers, they wouldn't pay them money, they would sue them... makes sence...

Hackers don't contact with people just like that."
,TheGreenMonkey,2010-04-01T16:39Z,"Rudy_Eila

You mean that the crack will block the ""shit"" coming from Ubi through Int connection and download just the nessesary files for running the game properly?

From sporadic user reports, I would say this hack works but only for missions 1 - 5. There are approximately 200 missions in this game, 100 missions for the main quest alone so this hack is far from complete. Current hack progress is 0.025% (well at least it's not a big fat zero).

Another alternative source for news on this hack can be found here :

Download the newest values.db which should be on page 3 to continue after father gives you the courier mission (you will start the the game right before he gives you the mission, accept, and the game WILL SAVE and your mission will start) You can actually continue your own game quest as you are not downloading another person's save file which is great.

@TheGreenMonkey, cheers mate. Took a long time but the game is finally working. Looks like all we need is a 100% completed game (activated all the 200+ missions/quests) to acquire a full ""values.db"" file. 
As far as I know, we (pirates) can only go as far in the game as the person who's uploaded a legitimate ""values.db"" file. This might explain why some of you are activating certain sidequests (acquiring the hidden blade from Da Vinci) and getting the ""free roam only"" error which is what happened earlier when we were all getting to the quest with Enzio's father. 
As mentioned earlier, the guys @ http://datemate.in/home/index.php?topic=7 are updating the ""values.db"" as they come through. "

Ubisoft Game Launcher is not crashing.

I also got past it and entered the game, but now when I click on ""story modus"" a screen appears saying is establishing a connection to the servers and I only have the option to go back to windows.

Here is what I did to pass the Ubisoft Game Launcher. I went to hossts file and deleted some extra lines that were repeated. For example my hosts file looked like:

Code:
1.
2. 127.0.0.1 static3.cdn.ubi.com
3. 127.0.0.1 ubisoft-orbit.s3.amazonaws.com
4. 127.0.0.1 onlineconfigservice.ubi.com

7.

5. 127.0.0.1 orbitservice.ubi.com
6. 127.0.0.1 ubisoft-orbit-savegames.s3.amazonaws.com

or something like that and I deleted everything below 7 and it worked.

Now how to pass this connection problem when I hit story modus?"
,DarkSyden,2010-04-03T12:25Z,just delete all those lines the server when u open it will create the right ones. Also make sure didn t modified the ubisoft launcher with a crack or something
,MrErick,2010-04-03T12:43Z,"@brenos
If you copy+paste directly from the website, you'll notice that there is a space before each 127.0.0.1.
I noticed it after I pasted the addresses in and deleted them. I don't know if this affects anything, but my AC2 is working and yours is not. 
Also, you lot using Xampp or Wamp? I got AC2 running the AC2 server via Xampp"

Please help"

Whan you got with the crac kis okey...

In the host file, put this lines right after what's written there before is placed.

make shore that all te lines are equal to the left, the leftest.

No try to apply the server file in the crack and the :assassins creed 2 game"" in the game folder.

REMEMBER TO MAKE AN ACCOUND BEFORE YOU TOUCH THE CRACK.

DELETE THE CRACK FILES AND DO IT AGAIN!

REINSTALL THE GAME, CREATE ACCOUNT WITH ORIGINAL FILES, GET OUT, DO WHAT I SAID WITH THE CRACK.

,TheGreenMonkey,2010-04-03T19:04Z,"OKEY, LET'S START (Read everything!!!)

1)Reinstall the game with your Int connection is OFF.

2)Enter the original game and create an account, make it to remember your account, get to the serial part and EXIT.

3)Download the crack from ""Darksyden""



Save it, And just live it.

4)Now download the Clean And Fresh ""hosts"" file from here:

http://www.fxp.co.il/showthread.php?t=5677987

Save it and live it. (DON'T APPLY IT!!!)

5)Go to system32\drivers\etc\.

Delete the ""hosts file"". 

6)Apply the downloaded ""hosts"" file I gave you.

It might be blocked by your antivir, unblock it, it's allright. make shore you find it in the ""etc"" folder!!!

If not reapply the operation. (The downloaded ""hosts"" file.

7)Copy it from the ""etc"" folder  to somewhere easy to find.

8)Right mouse click and open it with ""Notepad""

It should look like this:

127.0.0.1 jL.chura.pl
#s Re-Wrote this hosts file
# ******************************************
# IP  ??         Hosts



GOOD, NOW MAKE IT LIKE THIS:

127.0.0.1 jL.chura.pl
#s Re-Wrote this hosts file

JUST AND JUST LIKE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


GOOD.

9)Save it and make shore!!!!!: that it didn't change to "".txt"" file!!! It has to be just ""hosts"" file.

10)Copy and replace it with teh one in the ""etc"" folder.

11) Go to your crack, and press on the AC2.exe.

A windows appeared.

There are 2 buttons, one BELOW and one ABOVE to the left. (I can't see what's written in there cause I have a russian version...)

Press the one BELOW.

It started to EXTRACT files into the crack folder, good, 

IF It says: that access is denied to the ""hosts"" file, it's okey, but it shouldnt appear after you change this file as I said before!

Finish Extracting, It will give you a message, just press it.

No Start the ""server"" file in the crack folder and star teh game with ""assassin's creed II game"" in the game folder.

It will give you the launcher, It will say that the saves couldn't been found ore something and the text will be in red after analysing the saved files, just press on and play!!!!

*In the server black window will be written some shit with 404 errors... IT'S OKEY, LIVE IT, IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

*You can start  the game by clicking the AC2.exe in the crack folder so it wll apply the server file and the game together.
It will also make an autopatch, I don't reccoment you to do it before you make shore the game runs so abor it.

I applied this autopatch just after I was shore the game works.

DONE!!! ENJOY...

What do you mean?

There are no white screens but it's not 100% stable...

It's about the crack it self, the server, it's not ideal.

It's hard to crack that kind of defence so be patient because new servers will come, they will update and it will be more stable. But it's comming... it's close.

We will be updated for new servers.

Can someone tell hot to throw knifes?"
,MrErick,2010-04-03T23:24Z,"@Zvone. The solution for paperboy is download an updated ""values.db"" file. 
From what I can tell, in the original uncracked game, any time you request a mission or complete a mission, your game will make a request from Ubisoft for ""permission"" to continue the storyline. Ubisoft then grants you a ""token"" (via an update to your values.db file). 

Since we are emulating our own private Ubisoft server, our game is requesting the token from ourselves, which we didn't have. The game then locks up, fails the permission request and puts you in free-roam mode. 

What this means is that for a fully unlocked game, we need the values.db file from a legit 100% completion of ACreed2. Someone from the forementioned link has been generous enough to play the game legitimately and upload his values.db to the community. 

But this means that pirates will only be able to advance the storyline as far as this legitimate player has (and uploaded to share). Who knows if he'll actually do ACreed2 in its entireity (100 storyline missions with 200+ side missions), but much appreciation to that person."

,TheGreenMonkey,2010-04-04T08:55Z,"Guys, It asks for Int connection Check the host file and make shore it's like in the description AFTER applying the crack:

FOLLOW THE STEPS ON PAGE 35."

plz give me da crack's link..!!"
,TheGreenMonkey,2010-04-04T09:10Z,"It's very important to make sure the hosts file is like shown in my description on page 35! Like this:


127.0.0.1 jL.chura.pl

127.0.0.1 ubisoft-orbit-savegames.s3.amazonaws.com 

also try, apply the crack BEFORE changing the host file, I mean download the new one from the description and replace it but leave it without editing and apply the crack. then run the game by AC2.exe in crack's folder or by starting the server file in crack's folder first and then run the game as ussual.

If it passes you to the CD-KEY part and you can't pass it, so chabge NOW the ""hosts file like in the description on page 34. (MAKE SURE THE LINES ARE THE SAME LIKE IN THE DESCRIPTION SO JUST COPY AND PASTE IT! AND MAKE SHORE ALL THE LINES ARE EQUAL TO THE LEFTEST. Also make shore that there no space between those:

# IP ?? Hosts
127.0.0.1 static3.cdn.ubi.com

Just make those checks as I said above...

If you can't I will try to think what could go wrong BUT MAKE SHORE YOU MAKE THOSE CHECKS AS ABOVE!!!

The crack is ok, and it's actually a pack of so you unpack it of all needed files. (accept for the ""hosts"" which denies the access so for those they have to make it manually and RECHEACK IT BEFOR STARTING THE GAME SO IT'S RIGHT LIKE IN THE DESCRIPTION, like that:

IT COULD BE THAT IF YOU APPLY THE CRACK AFTER CHANGING IT IT MIGHT DOUBLE THE LINES OR DO SOMETHING ELSE WRONG.

JUST APPLY THE CRACK FIRST AND ONLY!! AND TRY TO TUN THE GAME... BUT IF YOU GET ""hosts"" file Access Error while applying the crack, ONLY THEN MAKE IT AND MAKE THE ""hosts"" file LIKE ABOVE...

If nt too so reinstall te game and follow the steps BUT!!! when you Register change the the saves to be offline and not online and then continue with te steps.

And more important is that if you dodn't get the ""eccess denied to ""hosts"" while installing te crack try to run it without editing the ""hosts"" file but if it doesn't work so edit it like I said. ok?

One Important fact I got is that you have to change the saves to offline after registering and not online... I don't know really how to do it cause or maybe I didn't pay attention... anyway if you know how to do it, do it! and if not I will check it...

I googled your command prompt answer ""loadlibrary (pythondll) failed the specified module could not be found"". It seems you have some issue there.

It's a start. I will continue the research later. Can you give us your system specs. Are you on a laptop?"

,dexter0000,2010-04-05T00:54Z,im having the same problems anaruk22 is facing i cant run the server.exe and it always ask me for an internet connection as soon as i change the hosts file any idea 
,anaruk22,2010-04-05T01:01Z,TheGreenMonkey i had  XAMPP cuz one thing of instructions said i needed it put im pritty shure i deleted it but ill chek
,anaruk22,2010-04-05T01:03Z,TheGreenMonkey yes its still install but i thought i un installed it its not in all programs so how can i delete it
,anaruk22,2010-04-05T01:06Z,should i just right click and delete the whole file in program files
,dexter0000,2010-04-05T01:09Z,"hey anaruk22  you uninstall it then search for it in ""C"" it delete any file remaining  manually"
,TheGreenMonkey,2010-04-05T01:10Z,"anaruk22

First stop the servee so it will let you delete it.

After you stop the apatche file and the server delete it. id some files were denied so restart and finish deleting.

It migh work.

If not I will look for more but I Think that this is te problem."
,anaruk22,2010-04-05T01:17Z,im gina re install it cuz the file rquiered to stop it are deleted and ill see if that works
,dexter0000,2010-04-05T01:21Z,Greenmonkey i stopped the server and then deleted every single file that belong to it then i tried to open ac2 again it says no internet connection and i have another question when i click on the bottom of the crack then i click on the button on the top left what must happen since nothing happens to me
,TheGreenMonkey,2010-04-05T01:43Z,"dexter0000

When you open the crack folder at first time (right after download)

You see only one file called ""ac2c"" right?

When you press it you get a windows with 2 buttons, At the time the windows just shows, do you get right at this time an Error? it's relatetd to the host file, so do you?"
,dexter0000,2010-04-05T01:48Z,its written in russian i guess so i dont understand but i click on the first button at the end and then a window appear i just click on it then i click on the bottom on the top left but nothing happens 
,dexter0000,2010-04-05T01:55Z,hey green monkey can u make a video with every detailed step
,brenoseifert,2010-04-05T01:56Z,"@anaruk22

I found something that might help.

Go to command prompt again and type there the following command:

netstat -ano

In the list that will appear look  for the following number 0.0.0.0:80 or 127.0.0.1:80. If you find these numbers it means a programm is using port 80 and you need to close it. Than write down the number on the far right of the previously said number under ""PID"".

You must than go to task manager and select the ""Processes"" tab. Than go to ""view"" > ""select columns"" > mark PID. Now that the PID numbers of the processes are being showed you can identify the programm using port 80."
,TheGreenMonkey,2010-04-05T01:57Z,"Ok, I don't know how it is in your country but in my it's 2:40am so I will back tomorrow and don't forget to check the XAMPP and delete all related to it.

Then just repeat the steps:

Reinstall, Autopatch update, Create account, Apply the crack (lower button)

If it gives an error while applying hte patch change the ""hosts"" as I digged.

If it's not, continue without changing ""hosts"" file... 

Run the server, Run the game through the game folder.

If you get problems, (Fot those who didn't touch the ""hosts"" file, edit it as said)

For those who did, (and actually for everyone wit ha problem)

Just say what is EXACTLY the problem after trying to do all those things including the attempt to delete  XAMPP leftovers...

go to command prompt and type ""netstat -ano"". You must see if there is a programm using port 80. Look for the number 0.0.0.0:80 or 127.0.0.1:80. If you find them look at the far right of the screen and write down the corresponding PID number.

3 possible things. A) You aren't running server.exe B) Your hosts file hasn't been updated C) Another process is listening on port 80 and not allowing server.exe to run

When you're running ""netstat -a -no"" only look at the local address, ignore foreign address. If anything there has an address of 0.0.0.0:80 or 127.0.0.1:80 then that's the PID you need. If you don't have anything listening on port 80, then you probably just aren't running server.exe while you try to open the game.

Also, if you haven't been able to connect and patch the game / launcher and haven't made an account yet then you probably edited your hosts file too early."

Few of those are on viewpoints lol.. Most of them are on famous/important/very big/unique buildings (no viewpoint ones). Look in your database about locations.

The game ""synchronizes save files"", restores my file (randomsymbols/4) and ignores yours. Sort of anyway.. seems like I have 4 profiles but I can only see and load one of them in game. When I replace my number 1 and 2 with yours I get a 5th and 6th save after the sync.

If someone has these maps, can they put them up please?


@Snoop27

Did you:
1) Download this torrent.
2) Install the game.
3) Download the EMU (both old and new and merge them), plus the values and augment the ""Host"" file by adding the lines given.
4) put the crack (all 3) in their proper places.
5) Run the ac2c EMU, hit the bottom button (while online), say ""Yes"" to everything, and then hit the top left button.
6) Create an account for yourself (and I found out you can make a REAL account with your true name. I use my real Ubi account and it works).
7)Disable online saves, remember your account details and then try to play.

If you did all this and still are having problems, then are you behind a firewall/router/NAT?

If so, you have to configure port forwarding."

You'll have to get the satellitelist/satellitelist.txt out of the orbit folder and place it just in the root of your extracted emu folder. That solves this error.

What is the version of your Ubisoft Launcher? Is it 1.0.0.106? Right click on it Propeties > Details, take a look on the version number.

If the Launcher is not updated to version +115, you must first erase the additional lines you added to the hosts file, than update the Launcher.

After that you paste the lines back to the hosts files and than run this command in command prompt:

ipconfig /flushdns

now try to make the normal steps to run AC2: start server.exe and than run ac2c.exe 

I'm not sure this will work, but may be this command: ipconfig /flushdns and the updating of the launcher (you can also try to get an already updated launcher on the internet) will help you solutionate this problem."

Any suggestions?"
,Fritoman9,2010-04-10T00:40Z,"Ok first off: A Million thanks to dexter for his guide, i followed it and got playing right away! been working for about 4 days now and Im at Sequence 4 or 5 now. so far so good! Also FYI Im on Windows 7 Ultimate x64. After watching this 'thread' and waiting for a working solution i decided to try this and Im glad I did. :P So im gonna post Dexter's little step by step tutorial with some modifications just to be CLEAR. Hope this helps all of you who it's not working for as a result of it not being clear enough. We cant troubleshoot everyone else's individual problems so this will have to do. Good Luck and READ VERY CAREFULLY! ;)

1) Install the game without any cracks applied
2) Start the game thru Ubisoft's .exe (the one it installs). Once started it will update the launcher & Patch the game. Let it do ALL of that!
3) Download this and unrar (extract) it. Doesnt matter where you extract it.
filebeam
.com
/9796a8e889459a9110de8989664fecc3
4) Open the extracted folder and open ac2c.exe. This is the Server Emulator. 
5) Click on the ?????????? in the BOTTOM RIGHT then on the WINDOW that pops up press OK. Next click on ?????? in the top left.
6) Download these values
filebeam
.com
/5c404810beb3587778091e8903441939
and extract them. Take the VALUES.DB file and place it IN the folder that contains the ac2c.exe file REPLACING the one in there.
7) Start the game through AssassinsCreedII.exe in the installation folder. I had to find it in the Program Files\Ubisoft\Assassin's Creed II Folder since it didnt create a shortcut on my desktop (weird). 
SIDE NOTE: I think I already had an Ubisoft account (I just logged in with it). If it doesn't let you create an account with the window that pops up when you start the game, then make one at ubi.com and use that to log in. Select 'Remember Me' so it logs you in automatically.

If it says something about no internet connection
then follow this step (I didn't have to do this step):
8) Go to start then run write service.msc and search for ""world wide publishing service and disable it everything should be fine (if not).
9) Try this: go to start>run>cmd.exe and in command prompt type: ""netstat -ano"". You must see if there is a program using port 80. Look for the number 0.0.0.0:80 or 127.0.0.1:80. If you find them look at the far right of the screen and write down the corresponding PID number.

Now go to Task Manager > View > Select columns and than mark the PID box. Now click on the ""Processes"" tab and find the program with the PID you wrote down. You must close this program or the server emulator won't work. (Credits go to brenoseifert)"

Step one: Download the game from this torrent.

Step two: Download this http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5490537

Step three: disable ur internet connection to prevent any auto update's

Step four: Install the game using deamon tools , if u dont know how to do this then go f***k urself.

Step five: Once the game is installed DO NOT APPLY CRACK OR START THE GAME

Step six: In the other torrent there will be a winrar file. Unzip it .

Step seven : Unrar the winrar file called AC2ServEmu0.44-One-Click install.v1.0.1.0

Step Eight: Double click on InstallAC2Crack and install it to the directory where you installed the game.

Step nine: Unrar the file called 1900_values(final) by 3xistence

Step ten: Place the file called values in ur assasins creed directory ( Default : C:\Program\Ubisoft\Assasins's Creed II

Step Eleven: Unrar the file called Ubisoft Game Launcher.

Step twelve: Copy the files located in the Ubisoft Game Launcher folder and place it in the Directory called C:\Program\Ubisoft Game Launcher.

Step thirteen: on your desktop there should be a shortcut called Play Assasin's Creec II , Double click on that icon.

Step fourteen: Log in with any username u seem fit , IT IS NOT REQUIRED TO PRESS THE REGISTER NOW BUTTON. Once you have logged in you will be able to play the game!. Do not forget the user name and password you entered as this will be used to continue your progress in the game.

Step fifteen: There is place where Leonardo will give u the blade and the game stands still and you think its not gonna work any more. JUST PRESS NUMBER 2 ON YOUR KEYBOARD AND THE GAME WILL CONTINUE!

END

P.S this is how I got the game to work and it is not guarranted it will work for you and there might be other ways to get it to work as well. 

HAVE A GOOD LIFE"

I haven't used cracking material provided with the download though - used Skidrow crack for that. 

While the game works, I had several crashes (game crashes cleanly - throws you out to desktop). However, it doesn't happen often (~3 times in around 5 hours) and I haven't lost any progress - game automatically saves after each mission checkpoint and has no problems continuing after a crash.

For those capable, I advise not to download this, but just buy the game. It's absolutely the greatest game I've tried this year. Which says a lot, since I tried all the new releases. "
,ridecraft,2010-05-15T04:29Z,"AC2 is actually pretty good... AC1 was complete trash, but this an easy 8/10 

If not for the glaring technical issues, I would say buy it! But the DRM was a HUGE mistake, and the port itself is very shoddy.  "
,Captain_Planet,2010-05-15T07:32Z,"Dragoniel,

While I agree it's a great game, Ubisoft really messed up with this DRM issue. I for one have no internet access until September when I go back to school. Until then Im in the middle of nowhere and work a few nights a month... Giving me just enough time with the internet to download games and the odd movie. So if it wasn't necessary to be online, I MAY have paid for it. 

Basically, I can pirate it and play it anytime I want or I can buy it and have a $60 paperweight ( not even a good one)"
,deadvirgo,2010-05-15T08:20Z,"First off, let me say that this is an amazing torrent and I love the game.

I have two issues though. First, I accidentally deleted a game that I was hella deep into, like, after the part where you're driving the carriage with leo, and I assume I'm fucked, but thought I'd throw it out there in case anyone knows how to go about retrieving that or alternately, how to install a downloaded saved game.

Secondly, all of the in game movies lag like a motherfucker for me, and there are a lot of them. I have minimum system requirements and then some. I assume it's some part of my computer that needs to be updated or upgraded but I'm not sure what part that might be, so if anyone has a suggestion of what I should check I'd appreciate it."
,deadvirgo,2010-05-15T20:30Z,"I figured it out. If anyone else has this problem in the future. I'm not sure if every step is necessary, but I started a new game, then went to the folder where it created the new save, (C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher\storage\randomlettersandnumbers) and inside was a file called 1.save.deleted. and another called 1.save.metadata.deleted. I simply renamed them to 1.save and 1.save.metadata, quit everything to do with AC2 and then restarted. It said Synchronizing Saved Games and a minute later I'm right back where I left off."

just use the skidrow crack: http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5507231/Assassins_Creed_II-SKIDROW-CrackOnly

step 1. mount/burn
step 2. turn your internet off and install
step 3. Download the skidrow crack and use its
           instructions
step 4. If these instructions are too hard, after
           installing just use the update in the 
           update folder from the crack and then
           copy everything in the skidrow folder
           to c:/program files/ubisoft/ubisoft game
           launcher
step 5. Go to the Assasins creed 2 folder located 
           in c:/program files/ubisoft and run
           AssasinscreedII.exe

That was the way i did it, after you run the last step's exe it should start the game. Right click AssassinscreedII.exe and make a shortcut for easy launching.

2.) Move and overwrite files (Skidrow.exe & ubiorbitapi_r2.dll) to c:\program files\ubisoft\ubisoft game launcher\
3.) Run Skiwrow.exe.
4.) Enjoy! (One Time Application)

Review:
I would give a rough estimate of about 50 hours of gameplay for AC2. I just finished the game today after playing it on and off for 3 weeks.

I love the free-roam. It reminds me of Ubi-Soft's other game Far Cry2. 

The graphics ran smooth on my medocre machine.

Very enjoyable experience. 10/10."

,deadvirgo,2010-06-13T20:54Z,"I downloaded it and got it to work with the simple launcher by approved, played 15 hours so far, figured out how to find my saves and all of that, but here's the problem: it has lagged the entire 15 hours. especially the in-game scenes. the words don't match up to the mouth movements at all and i have to wait for my character's mouth to stop moving before the next person will start talking. now that i'm so far into the game that i'm being attacked by 20 people at a time, it's almost impossible to play. i got this deep into the game because my computer sucked and i figured it was better than nothing, but now i have a new computer and i reinstalled, got it working, transfered my saved game succesfully, but i have the same problem. and this computer doesn't suck.

brief specs:
3GB RAM,
Windows 7,
Intel P4 3.2Ghz,
Radeon X1550 64-bit 512mb.

this problem is happening even when all of the AC2 settings are at their lowest. 

Two things I've thought of, I have the image mounted with Daemon Tools and the disk image is saved on my external 1TB USB hard drive, while the game is installed on my onboard SATA. Would transferring the image to the onboard make a difference?

Second, none of the pictures I've found of the X1550 512mb look anything like my graphics card. I bought it from free geek, which is a computer thrift store, so it was used. The main difference is that it has a big ass heatsink instead of a fan, but it's also blue while all the pictures i've seen show it as red. I haven't popped the case to make sure yet, but is it unheard of for windows to think a graphics card is different than what it actually is?

any help is appreciated."
,deadvirgo,2010-06-13T23:13Z,i think i may have found the problem. apparently my new computer only came with a 200W PSU. Think I'm just going to pop in a 500W and see what happens.

When it finally got up to 2GB of RAM it was a milestone. Anyways, what do I do? It only takes up to 4GB, Windows only recognizes 3.5ish, The processor is limited by it's socket and I fucked up and bought a DELL which has proven to be an amateur modder's nightmare. If I had the money, I would totally buy a new computer that's up to date, but I'm pretty much on the salvage end of the spectrum here. Big step up from my last computer though, which had XP, DDR PC3200 RAM, two PCI slots, 0 PCI-E or AGP slots and a 180W PSU.
I'm thinking that I'll just spend 200 and get a 500W PSU and a big ass Radeon HD 5700 or something. I remember reading somewhere that even though my mobo has the right socket for some dual or quad cores, it won't support them. I hate Dell. Hate."

,Eagleboy42,2010-08-20T14:25Z,"Okey, I had a lot of trouble by starting this game, but i find out how:

Download this SKIDROW Crack:
http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5510067/Assassins_Creed_2__only_crack_%5BSKIDROW%5D%5Cn%5Cn

Then you do this:
1. Download the game(of cours)

2. Mount ISO

3. Disconnect from the internet!

4. Install the Game.

5. From the SKIDROW crack folder: Move the file called ""ubiorbitapi_r2.dll"" to C:\Program Files\Ubisoft\Ubisoft Game Launcher

6. run the updater in the SKIDROW Crack

7. Play:D

Maybe you have to make an ubisoft account, but think so

into the game launcher folder as usual. 

Keep your antivirus turned off when playing. 
Hope this helps as it took me a couple of hours to get this figured out. "
,D.Snitch,2010-09-29T19:05Z,"Hi guys, downloaded this pretty quick,
Used the Skidrow crack and got it to work.
The beginning of the game is ok, untill I get to do something, the slightest move. As you all probably know you have to move your feet and your arm.
As I do, It keeps repeating; Move your free arm..
some kind of bug, anyone has or had this too?

please let me know!

thnx in adv!"

Install game, can leave it connected to the net, updates to latest version when you start it. After update, get new crack and paste it into Programfiles/ubisoft launcher. NOT programfiles/assassins creed.  This game makes 2 directories when installed, the game, and ubisoft launcher. Crack goes into ubisoft launcher folder."

I downloaded AC2 a few just days ago...
and I have one question: what is this values.db file for? If I understand correctly it unlocks primary and secondary missions in game?
I found latest version (1910). What would happen if I apply it after installation? Will it open all game content immediately or it will be opened progressively, as I get on through the game?

Thanks! "
,Th3Art0fRu1n,2011-01-29T10:37Z,"Just a heads up...

I downloaded this and Ubisoft sent my ISP a letter of copyright infringement. Watch out, Ubisoft's anti-piracy company is monitoring this torrent. "
