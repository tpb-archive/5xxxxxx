Review: http://www.bigozine2.com/archive/ARrarities08/ARbdislewight.html

Just the straight concert from keithdylan's Reel to Reel source

With thanks to keithdylan I have tidied up his Reel to Reel source to present the complete
show in as clean as possible condition. No alterations have been made to the sound other
than using the best channel in each track, removing a few gliches, cleaning track
transitions and fading where needed.

I consider this to be the best source I have heard and do not like composite recordings
so made this for my own listening pleasure. It came out well so here's hoping some others
may want a copy.

The original Torrent notes are included

I purchased this reel at auction recently.  The company I won it from had it transferred for me to cd.
The studio that transferred it did it all to one track.  Thatâ€™s why there is a second cdr in the transfer.
I think this is very close to the master tape.  A couple of the reasons I think this are, would someone
really waste a 10 inch reel to make a copy of a multi generational tape?  Also, has anyone else ever seen
a copy with a Ritchie Havens version of a Dylan song that seems to be recorded at the same show?

This is the same recording that has been the basis for most of the Isle of Wight boots throughout the years.
There is very little hiss on the tape.  There are no vinyl sounds.  It contains every song Dylan played at
the show. It has the starts and stops between most songs that are found on all versions of this show.
There is another audience version that was on Pink Robert that did the same start and stop between songs.
I wonder if all the tapers had bought into the rumor of Dylan playing for three hours and were trying to
save tape.  I bet if they knew it was only going to be an hour they may have let it roll.  There is no more
music on this version than any other I have found. What it does have is a bit more audience here and there.
It also has Bob telling the crowd, â€œYou look great,â€ after Lay Lady Lay, that I canâ€™t find on any of my other
sources.  I think this tape, or a version of it, served as the source for the master to the TMOQ version as
that version and this tape have Rainy Day Women ending at the same spot, while a complete recording of the
song exists from this taper.  I donâ€™t think this was used as the master for that boot, as the boot has
the songs out of order, and this tape has them in order of performance.  This show is one of my favorites
and I purchased this tape in hopes of unearthing a new treasure.  While I didnâ€™t get that, I think I did get
a source very close to the master, I really think itâ€™s a first generation, as the sound on this is very warm,
and the solo acoustic stuff never has sounded better, IMO.  There might be versions that eqâ€™ed the heck out
of their source, but none that sound so pure and unadulterated.  I had the studio do nothing to the tape,
just transfer it.  No noise reduction, e.q., anything.  I also didnâ€™t try to correct any of the imperfections,
as there are some on the tape.  There is static in a couple of spots, and a couple of songs have portions
repeated.  Iâ€™m not saying this is anything new or revolutionary, but I do think I have a very close to the
master source. I was told these reels had not seen the light of day since around 1971.  They sure looked old. 
It was bundled with another reel of the original 13 Basement Tapes songs.  There was nothing at all new on
that one. The owner worked for KMET radio in Los Angeles.  Iâ€™ve included photos of the reel.  I paid a couple
of bucks for these and my way of getting my moneyâ€™s worth is by sharing them with as many people as possible. 
Please share this anywhere you like, but try to avoid places that will make you eliminate the officially
released songs. At least until itâ€™s had a good enough time to get out as is.  Hunger City is itâ€™s debut. 
I also hope someone will piece it together with the Pink Robert version and others, hello Self Portrait, to
make the ultimate/complete version.  Enjoy.
