,BigSniff,2010-03-17T17:05Z,"The thing that always makes me laugh, is that although anyone can reencode a movie so it's different size and bit rate, you always manage to replicate the out of sync and glitches perfectly.

,dlarrym,2010-03-17T19:28Z,"Hello extremezone!! another great upload.... I have seen this in the theater but saw an average version from a torrent site that was a CAM. The thing was that people were commenting and saying that aside from the technical quality -ie- audio quality, visual quality, there were people saying it was the worst story/plot they had ever seen and would NEVER recommend this movie based on its story not quality.. ANYWAY.... This movies is a GREAT story... so I have no idea how any person with a brain larger then a SHREW could say this was a crap movie. It was well written and the twists kept coming over and over again.... The ending was an AWESOME surprise, much like the end of ""The Sixth Sense"" when the flashbacks begin and the audiance then is brought into know that Bruce Willis's character is also one of the DEAD PEOPLE the boy could see. The kid just never mentioned it to Bruce Willis's character or didn't know himself for certain because the way they interacted as compared to the other dead people the kid would see (usually looking rather horrific and bloddy and such). Bruce Willis didn't look like the other dead the kid saw. ANYWAY.... This is a great movie.... up there with ""Silence of the lambs"" or ""STAY"" with Ryan Gossling and Ethan Hawk and Naomi Watts.... STAY is another excellent film!!! GREAT JOB extremezone, your fellow TPB member.!"

I thought the quality was great.  Watched it on my computer and didn't notice any hissing sound or video probs.
Might as well say thx for all the other movies I've downloaded from you... all great copies and ALL VIRUS FREE!

I must say that I figured out what was going on fairly early into it, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment at all and I will definitely watch it again. I didn't guess the twist in The Sixth Sense for example, but once I knew what it was about I lost interest in seeing it again.

p.s. i really liked the film. for thos who didn't:
watch the film a 2nd time and keep an eye on mark ruffalo's performance. its like he acted two different roles for your 1st and second watch"
,wilko1,2010-03-26T20:58Z,"Tempation to download this movie was too strong but I wish I had resisted. The picture is perfectly fine but the sound is so bad as to make it unwatchable. At quite a few places it is out of sync and throughout sounds like it was recorded with a mike located in a biscuit tin - dreadful. I gave up about 35 minutes in. I'll wait for someone like FXG to do a DVDRip.
Yeah - I know I sound incredibly ungrateful for someone who just got a freebie but felt it only fair to inform others thinking of downloading this just exactly what they'll get.
Shame because the movie looks pretty good."

R5 are never as good but they do get released months before so if you cant wait they are great but put up with average to sometimes a little crappy quality, or if you wait brilliant quality then wait for it to be released on dvd then download it. Simples!

Those of you that are mouthing off and bitchin like the uneducated obese inbred mummy's boys that you are, we don't see you uploading anything do we!!

,The Hawk,2010-05-06T16:12Z,"What does R5 mean?  Obviously NOT a DVD rip!  Audio is poor, echos a lot, out of sync in some places.  Better than a cam rip so I'm not complaining."
