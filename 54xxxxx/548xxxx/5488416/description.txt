Avast Internet Security 5.0.492
Full Version with key

avast! provides a package of applications that aim to protect your computer 
from a possible virus infection or other malware threat. If you use it correctly, 
and in combination with other programs such as data backup utilities, 
it will significantly reduce the risk of your computer being attacked or 
infected by a virus, and thus the risk of losing important or private data.
The Avast! Internet Security application comes with an antispam filter and 
built-in firewall. Once installed, avast! runs silently in the background to protect 
your computer against all known forms of malware. You don't need to do anything else - 
just install and forget! Active internet users need greater protection for 
themselves as they shop and bank on-line. To secure against threats from infected 
web sites and the growing risk of identity theft, avast Internet security provides 
you with continuous protection from its layers of antivirus, anti-spyware, 
anti-rootkit protection, firewall and antispam.

Real-time shields. The real-time shields are the most important part of 
the program, as they are working continuously to prevent your computer from 
becoming infected. They monitor all your computer's activity, 
checking all programs and files in real-time - i.e. at the moment a program 
is started or whenever a file is opened or closed.

Virus Chest. The virus chest can be thought of as a folder on your hard disk 
with special properties, that make it a safe, isolated place for storing 
potentially harmful files. You can work with the files in the virus chest, 
with some security restrictions.

avast! antispam filter. avast! Internet Security includes a fully integrated 
antispam filter to detect unwanted email.
Spam delivered to your mailbox can result in your mailbox quickly becoming full, 
as a result which, legitimate emails may not be received. It can also unnecessarily 
increase the load on the email server, internet connection, local networks etc.

Firewall. avast! Internet Security includes a fully integrated firewall which 
can be controlled directly from the avast! user interface.
The firewall monitors all communication between your computer and the outside 
world and blocks unauthorized communication based on a number of "allow" and "deny" rules. 
In this way, the firewall can prevent sensitive data from leaving your computer and 
can also block attempted intrusions by external hackers

Command-line scanner. The ashCmd program uses the same avast! scanning engine 
to detect potential malware infections so the results are exactly the same as 
running a scan via the normal program interface. The avast! command-line scanner, 
ashCmd.exe, is normally installed in the directory C:Program FilesAlwil Softwareavast5.
A scan is run from the command prompt using various switches and parameters. 
To see a description of the parameters, locate the ashCmd file and double click on it. 
This will open a new window in which the various parameters are displayed.
