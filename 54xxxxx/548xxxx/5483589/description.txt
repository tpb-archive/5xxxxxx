In 1998 the British Broadcasting Corporation became the first production company ever to dramatise the entire canon of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories and novels. 

This unique undertaking began in 1989 with Holmes' and Watson's first adventure, A Study in Scarlet and ended with their most famous, The Hound of the Baskervilles. 

Starring in all of the original Doyle adventures are Clive Merrison and Michael Williams. 

The success of the programmes led to four follow-up series of new stories, The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. These new adventures star Clive Merrison and Andrew Sachs. 

The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes were written by Bert Coules in the same style of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
The stories come from cases mentioned in the original Sherlock Holmes stories.
