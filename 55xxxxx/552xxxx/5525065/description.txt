lOGO FREE HQ Music Video's for VJ use playing back from a PC. NOT these are the Original VOB files have not been messed about with in Xvid or MP4 to save on the download size.   

If big files are a problem for you, buy a larger hard drive and MORE BANDWIDTH, please do not murder these by re encoding as some have from Demonoid as mp4 or Xvid rip off's, and then claiming you have done the World a favour Grrr.   

This is the real deal for the few out there who care.   Note some aspect 4:3 Ratio files require tweaking back to 16:9 as the original was ripped to DVD with the correct pixel size but wrong aspect ratio.  Any VJ worth his salt will be able to fix that.

All I have done is split the VOB's into music track and title them the same as the sleeve and then re tagged the music video's so they will import correctly into most PC or MAC VJ software.   I don't include the sleeve JPG, as no Video Jockey I know uses obsolete Physical (DVD) media any more and all play digital copies from a hard drive.

Please see torrent files for the track listings.   Thank You.
