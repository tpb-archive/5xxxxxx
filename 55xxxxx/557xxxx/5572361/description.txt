Ben's secret identity is revealed to the entire world, and he is now a megastar superhero loved and favored all over by kids, teenagers, but distrusted by many adults. After having a long talk with Julie in Ben's brand new car, Kevin and Gwen arrive in Kevin's car and tell Ben where to find the one who told his secret to the world and they go to "pay him a visit". When they arrive they find out how the tattletale, a young boy named Jimmy Jones, figured out Ben's identity and with his help discover an alien attack in Florida. When they arrive at the site (using Kevin's new jet), Ben is arrested by the local police. Luckily, NASA needs the assistance of the Plumbers so Gwen and Kevin manage to get Ben out of jail. After being briefed on the situation they try and fail to foil a robbery by an unknown alien whose DNA is scanned by the Ultimatrix. They follow the thief to find out that he is an alien refugee named Bivalvan from the Andromeda Galaxy who was only stealing the NASA equipment to build a ship he could use to go home. However, this would require detonating a nuclear bomb, which would destroy central Florida. Ben manages to stop him by wrapping him in Ultimate Spidermonkey's web. Bivalvan informs them that an alien named Agreggor is after him and some other aliens that were kidnapped, but they leave him in the web and say that the Plumbers will take him home safely. Later, Ben reluctantly returns to school with some encouragement and a first kiss from Julie (on the cheek). He goes in and is soon greeted with applause, particularly from his old bullies Cash and JT. Some time later Bivalvan is found and subdued by Agreggor.
