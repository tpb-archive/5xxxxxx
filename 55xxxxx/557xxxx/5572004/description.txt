With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa is a World War II memoir by Eugene 

Sledge, a United States Marine. Since its first publication in 1981, With the 

Old Breed has been recognized as one of the best first-hand accounts of 

combat in the Pacific during World War II. The memoir is based on notes 

Sledge kept tucked away in a pocket-sized Bible he carried with him during 

battles.
