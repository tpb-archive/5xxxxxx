The Economist is an English-language weekly news and international affairs publication owned by The Economist Newspaper Ltd and edited in London.
Its average circulation tops 1.2 million copies a week, about half of which are sold in North America.

The newspaper aims "to take part in a severe contest between intelligence, which presses forward, and an unworthy, timid ignorance obstructing our progress." It practices advocacy journalism in taking an editorial stance based on free trade and globalization. It targets educated readers and boasts that its audience contains influential executives and policy-makers.
