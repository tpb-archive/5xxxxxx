Patents and Papers:

This is a collection of relevant patents, most of which have had the wording simplified and the illustrations upgraded with the intention of making them easier to understand. There are also some relevant scientific papers which explain important discoveries. These documents provide a large amount of exciting information, usually in great detail, and much of which is not contained elsewhere on this or other web sites. These patents are included in the complete book download mentioned earlier.

Patent 1: Howard Johnson's magnet motor patent 4,151,431. This patent describes a powerful motor which it claims can power an electrical generator.


Patent 2: Edwin Gray's electric motor patent 3,890,548. This 80 horsepower motor not only powers a vehicle but recharges a spare battery, making the vehicle effectively fuel-less in operation. Each of the three power tubes used with this engine can power lighting and heating instead of a motor if that is required.


Patent 3: Edwin Gray's electronic circuit patent 4,595,975. This patent shows the circuit which Edwin used to drive his 80 horsepower motor.

Patent 6: Stan Meyer's water-splitter patent application WO 92/07861. This shows the circuitry used by Stan to hold his water-splitter cell automatically on it's resonant point at all times.


Patent 7: Christopher Eccles' water-splitter patent 2,324,307. This details a cell which works on electrical pulses like Stan Meyer's but which has the electrodes outside the electrolysis cell.

Patent 11: Puharich's water-splitter patent 4,394,230. This shows how he splits water into hydrogen and oxtgen gasses using less power than is obtained by burning the gasses afterwards. It also covers his theories on how water can be split in an article written by him.


Patent 12: Shigeta Hasebe's high-efficiency electrolyser patent 4,105,528. This shows how to undertake electrolysis of water with at least 10 times the gas output of Farady's perceived maximum output. This simple cell should be able to double the actual measured outputs of the cell used to obtain the patent.

Patent 14: Archie Blue's electrolysis bubbler patent 4,124,463. Archie's cell operates very much like that of Charles Garrett, where air is drawn up through the electrolyte to dislodge the gas bubbles which have been formed by the electrolysis process.

Patent 16: Dan Davidson's Acoustic-Magnetic Power Generator patent 5,568,005. This device has no moving parts, and provides power to run other devices.


Patent 17: John Bedini's Motor/Generator patent 6,545,444. This device is not really a motor although it does have a rotating shaft. Its purpose is to capture excess energy which is used to charge additional batteries.


Patent 18: John Bedini's Permanent Magnet Motor/Generator patent 6,392,370. This device runs at very high efficiency and can power other pieces of equipment.


Patent 19: Ruggero Santilli's Underwater Arc Gas Generator patent 6,183,604. This patent shows a method of continuous hydrogen production through the use of a long-life electrode underwater arc system.


Patent 20: Stanley Meyer's patent on his water-splitting spark-plug device 5,149,407. This patent shows how Stan was able to run an engine through water injection directly into the engine cylinders and how the water was charged before injection.


Patent 21: Xogen's Water-Splitting Patent 6,126,794. This shows another version of Stan Meyers water-splitting cell, produced by his brother in law Stephen Chambers.


Patent 22: Juan Aguero's Hydrogen/Steam Patent Application EP0,405,919. This patent application describes a high efficiency method of converting water into hydrogen and oxygen gasses to be used a fuel for an engine.


Patent 23: Stephen Horvath's Hydrogen Car Patent 3,980,053. This patent shows a method for water electrolysis which it is claimed is able to power an engine. It shows the construction parts for adapting an existing car.


Patent 24: Charles Pogueâ€™s first high mpg carburettor patent 642,434. This is the first of three patents from Charles, each of which describes a high-efficiency carburettor and explains how it operates.

Patent 26: Charles Pogueâ€™s third high mpg carburettor patent 2,026,798. This is the third patent from Charles, showing further improvements to his design. This carburettor has been tested and the tests results claim a performance under normal driving conditions resulting in more than 200 miles per US gallon.


Patent 27: Ivor Newberryâ€™s high mpg carburettor/exhaust system patent 2,218,922. This is another design of carburettor which produces very high mileage results. There are more than 240 similar carburettor designs from different people, all claiming mpg figures in excess of 100 miles per gallon.


Patent 28: Robert Sheltonâ€™s high mpg carburettor patent 2,982,528. This is another carburettor design from the 240 claiming 100+ mpg figures.


Patent 29: Harold Schwartzâ€™s high mpg carburettor patent 3,294,381. This is another carburettor design from the 240 claiming 100+ mpg figures.


Patent 30: Oliver Tuckerâ€™s high mpg carburettor patent 3,653,643. This is another carburettor design from the 240 claiming 100+ mpg figures.


Patent 31: Thomas Ogleâ€™s high mpg carburettor patent 4,177,779. This is another carburettor design from the 240 claiming 100+ mpg figures.


Patent 32: Hermann Plaustonâ€™s atmospheric electricity patent 1,540,998. This shows how serious amounts of power can be taken from an aerial. This very long patent reads more like an instruction manual rather than a patent. Hermann describes a 100 kilowatt system as "small"!


Patent 33: Pavel Imrisâ€™s patent 3,781,601 for his Optical Electrostatic Generator which has an output more than nine times the input power and has no moving parts.
