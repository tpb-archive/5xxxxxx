Spider-Man Family (later retitled Amazing Spider-Man Family) began as a series of one-shots written and penciled by various writers and artists before becoming a bi-monthly ongoing series with the first issue cover-dated February 2007. Its initial writer was Sean McKeever. Each issue of Spider-Man Family contained brand new stories featuring Spider-Man and his supporting cast, reprints of classic Spider-Man tales, and an American translation of the original Japanese manga, Spider-Man J.

In June 2008, Spider-Man Family was rebranded as Amazing Spider-Man Family, and became a showcase title for many of the divergent timelines that had clustered the franchise. In addition to strips set in the Brand New Day timeline, a strip exploring the early days of Peter Parker's life as Spider-Man was also included. Another feature, Mr. and Mrs. Spider-Man, written by Tom DeFalco, took place within Marvel's MC2 continuity. 

In November 2008, Joe Quesada confirmed on his blog that cult favourite Spider-Girl would be moving to Amazing Spider-Man Family in April 2009. 

On July 13, 2009, Marvel announced a new monthly anthology title, Web of Spider-Man, to replace Amazing Spider-Man Family. Unlike Amazing Spider-Man Family, it will contain only new stories featuring Spider-Man with the only backup being Spider-Girl.
