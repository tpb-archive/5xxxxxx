Legend of the Seeker is a weekly American television series loosely based on The Sword of Truth novels by Terry Goodkind. Distributed in U.S. domestic syndication by Disney-ABC Domestic Television, ABC Studios is producing the series, which is in its first foray into broadcast syndication, with Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert, Joshua Donen, Ned Nalle and Kenneth Biller serving as executive producers. The show premiered on November 1, 2008. The series follows the epic journey of a young woods guide named Richard Cypher (played by Craig Horner), a mysterious woman named Kahlan Amnell (played by Bridget Regan), and a wizard named Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander (played by Bruce Spence) to stop Darken Rahl (played by Craig Parker) from unleashing an ancient and terrifying power. It has been renewed for a second season, which will begin airing November 7 2009. In 2009, the series won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series. Sam Raimi became interested in adapting The Sword of Truth novels to screen after his partner Joshua Donen encouraged him to read the books, and he in turn gave the books to Robert Tapert to read.
