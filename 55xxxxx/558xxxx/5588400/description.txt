A legendary computer scientist, trained astrophysicist, and highly respected investigator of unidentified aerial phenomena, Dr. Jacques Vallee unveils some of the computer-science roots of remote viewing. He tells of his role of consultant and advisor to SRI-International's human consciousness program, and his interactions with Hal Puthoff, Russell Targ, and particularly Ingo Swann through a long portion of the program's development. Along the way, he delves into some of the perplexities he sees as a scientist about the nature of time. Dr. Vallee also reveals a surprising trend he and his colleagues observed as they created Arpanet, the forerunner of the Internet. As computer scientists tried to cope with the relatively primitive computer communications processes then available, they noticed that what could only be described as psychic augmentation to the communications was filtering in to help the process along. Vallee also includes a fascinating description of a combined telepathic/remote viewing experiment done with Ingo Swann, Richard Bach (author of Bridge Across Forever and many other books), and others. During the question and answer period, Dr. Vallee answers questions about computers and consciousness, the watershed Comida UFO report, and certain other controversial UFO topics. 


Jacques Vallee was born in France, where he received a B.S. in mathematics at the Sorbonne and an M.S. in astrophysics at Lille University. He later received his Ph.D. in computer science and artificial intelligence from Northwestern University. Dr. Vallee was a senior researcher at SRI at the time the remote viewing program was being initiated in 1971. Jacques became informally associated with the program and is credited by Ingo Swann for suggesting the approach (based on information addressing) that led to the coordinate remote viewing protocol. A decade later, Dr. Vallee was brought back to SRI as a consultant and went through formal training with Ingo Swann.


Apart from his work with information technology and finance, Jacques has had a long-term private interest in astronomy, in writing fiction and in the frontiers of research, notably unidentified aerial phenomena. He serves as a general partner of a Silicon Valley group that invests in North America and Europe, primarily in high-technology, and on the scientific advisory board of Bigelow Aerospace.
