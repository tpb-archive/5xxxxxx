I'd rather pay to get the max quality on this instead of slumming it via download.  

$30 for both the blu ray + DVD in one box @ bestbuy...big deal...or you could spend weeks trying to download something much less than what you were hoping for.

I suppose the PS3 should play the disc nicely, if I buy it, since it plays any other bluray disc.

Also, remember that the a torrent is priority queued to favor those who have been in the swarm the longest, so get in their and be patient. 

Also, remember that the audio on this .mkv is DTS-HD encoded so you will need an HTPC without HDMI output connected to your HDTV in order to view this and hear the audio. This works with vlc media player and with xbmc media center software, remember too that your HTPC is going to need either a video decoder chip onboard or a Crysis level video card in order to keep up with the video bit-rate of this move."

setting your upload to unlimited is great, but it doesn't leave you any room for normal web browsing which I like to do sometimes while I wait for it to download. I've found 60Kb upload to be the sweet spot in my case. 768kb translates to 96KB - 60KB which leaves me with about 36KB left for torrent overhead and a decent browsing experience. You will have to find out what works for you, but honestly 256kb up isn't much to work with. Only thing I would suggest is upgrade your connection with your ISP if that's possible."

,TheStich,2010-04-28T01:29Z,"Worth the d/l : took me 2 days but worth it :)

A/V = spot on perfect. Unless you have 2 systems side by side you won't tell the difference from your armchair (even with a 100"" screen)

VLC plays perfectly - has 2x english sub tracks included in the mkv file. And remember, these new codecs are much more efficient at compressing and decompressing video than that used by BR, so 1/4 size doesn't mean 1/4 quality

And big ups to aoloffline - you deserve VIP for this one!"

,516849,2010-04-28T03:32Z,"@mw2fiend:
Your computer is not fast enough to handle the bitrate and quality of this movie. Try a faster computer. To get it on your PS3, you will need to copy it over a network. I use Azureus Vuze and it allows me to stream it to my PS3. You can then copy it to your PS3 and it will be there!

,j1zzle,2010-04-28T13:07Z,"A tip for people who may want to play it on their Xbox 360 or even PS3 and don't want to use Media Server or something to stream (it can be quite slow for HD content).

What I did was use a program called ""GotSENT"". It converts the MKV container to an MP4 container (MP4 is compatible with both PS3/Xbox). The great thing about this is that there is NO re-encoding involved at all... so that means NO quality loss whatsoever. Same quality you downloaded... just changes the container from MKV to MP4 :) 

Just a tip for someone who might want to watch off their external hard drives or whatever. The conversion itself takes a mere 15-20 mins (depending on your computer).

One thing I haven't figured out is getting the subtitles on the Xbox... hmm.. anyone got any tips?"

First: Patch Windows
Download and install ""Half open limit patch for Windows"" from http://half-open.com/
The site describes its function but basically Windows XP SP1 and later Windows versions reduce maximum connections to 10 to reduce spread of viruses etc. Use the program to set it to 100 and restart ur PC.
Second: configure uTorrent
Go to 'Preferences' and select 'Bandwidth'. Make sure ul and dl are both 0 (unlimited)
Set 'Global maximum connections' to '1000'
Set 'Maximum peers per torrent' to '250'
Set 'Number of upload slots to '4'
Next go to 'BitTorrent' and un-check 'Enable bandwidth management'. Set outgoing encryption to 'Enabled' AND LEAVE LEGACY CONNECTIONS CHECKED!
Third: Check your port is open
Go to 'Options' in uTorrent and choose 'Setup Guide'. Un-check 'Bandwidth' leve 'Network' checked. Change your port from your current one (even if its just by 1 eg: 2398 to 2399) and press 'Run Tests'. If your current port is not open you need to forward it in your modem or router.
Last: restart
Restart your computer and all network equipment such as modem etc. and uTorrent should work better. As im writing this my speed is peaking at 80KB/s!!
Hope it works for you all!"

I honestly can't fault it, no errors or crap and you have to look REALLY close to see any compression artifacts.
To all those who are having these problems with subtitles they are present and work just fine. You should all be playing this with VLC Media Player, if you aren't then DOWNLOAD IT NOW. Click 'Video' then 'Subtitles Track' and choose the top english one for Na'vi only subs.
If the video or audio skips or freezes its because your computer is too slow NOT because the torrent is crap. I have a $4000 computer with 2 GTX275 graphics cards and video playback is quite fine.
Basically if you are having problems playing this it is your fault not the torrents.
If your download speed is slow go to page 11 of the comments i posted some recommended settings for uTorrent."

,M0e09,2010-05-02T13:58Z,"@ zuriki:
the release of the secret myth group stands no chance against this torrent quality-wise. it's not even possible due to the bitrates... 8200 kbps vs. ~2000 kbps video and AAC vs. DTS sound... those are huge dieeferences... on bigger screens with a high end sound system you will most likely see huge differences, so think before posting.
Nevertheless, for most movies these 2GB rips are enough as I got plenty of them as well, bus on larger creens they don't stand a chance against 1080p rips with high bitrates."

i set this to download over night for like 4 nights in a row and i'll hit 40kb/s max and usually for not even a long time, yet i can dnld something with 100 seeds at 130kb/s
can we say hit n run?"
,paranoiahax,2010-05-02T22:36Z,"@fwee288

everyone's having this problem. I've been downloading it for the past 4 days and 7 hours (I'd said 3 days but that was an underestimation, I've just checked) and my average download speed has been 17kbps. It's an absolute joke. Fucking leechers on here. 

As for whether it can be played on xbox, I've just seen another post saying something about GotSENT. So I've downloaded this. Wondering what to do about subs for the navi parts though? I've downloaded the subs for it separately now and I've seen GotSENT has a separate option for subs so hopefully that will do the job."

One slight annoyance though. Great for supplying subtitles as softcoded, but because the fags at microsoft haven't added support for subtitles on the 360, i have no clue what they're saying during the Navi speaking parts. So maybe a copy with hardcoded navi subs would've been better but I can't really blame you for that because you would've probably suffered quality loss, much like I'll suffer quality loss if I hardcode them myself. 

So once again, thanks for the great upload! Will continue to seed until I hit 3, then I'll have to delete cos the file's too large for my shitty laptop to handle ;)

I've been downloading for 2 days now and I'm at 60%. Where I'm from, the max download speed I can get is 200 kB/s. But with this torrent it was from 20 - 40kB. I did what someone else suggested, I just followed the first thing and the speed went up to 200 (as much as possible)! So if you're havin' the same problem as I did, do the following:

uTorrent: Go to 'Preferences' and select 'Bandwidth':
Set 'Global maximum connections' to '1000'
Set 'Maximum peers per torrent' to '250'
Set 'Number of upload slots to '4'

Hope this helps!! Will seed after I'm done - looks like in 5 hours! Yeahhhh =))"

If you're using a LG tv, the problem is probably with the audio being DTS. LG tv's don't support this format.

No offence, but you must be pretty stupid if you are having problems playing this file.

First of all it WORKS FINE. I can confirm this once and for all. Audio, video and subtitles all work fine.

Second, this is a HD movie, meaning it wont play smooth if at all on an old piece of shit computer, you need a decent dedicated graphics card. If your computer has trouble playing games it probably wont play this.

Third, why are you trying to play this on a fucking ""Gay-station 3""???? throw that piece of shit in the garbage and buy a REAL gaming rig - a computer.

Fourth and finally USE VLC MEDIA PLAYER to play any media files. It literally plays everything in my 1TB+ media collection except .mov files, i don't think it plays those. .mp3, .wmv, .mp4, .wav, .iso (that's right it even plays .iso's of dvd video disks without the need to mount them in a virtual drive!), .mkv, .avi ect... everything!

So stop bitching and enjoy this movie!

I signed up to TPB just to post the fix-it ^_^

Q:	Embedded subtitles are not displayed
A:	

Right-click on the white Haali Media Splitter icon in the system tray (right-bottom of your screen). There you can select the subtitle that should be displayed.

If a subtitle is selected, but still not being displayed in Windows Media Player, then try enabling the option ""Autoload VSFilter"" in Haali Media Splitter. You can do that here: Start > Programs > K-Lite Codec Pack > Configuration > Haali Media Splitter > Options > Compatibility.

This fix applies to those with the K-Lite Codec pack installed. I'm not sure if it works for anything other than Media Player Classic but it should. ENJOY!!!!!"
,fibonacci89,2010-06-17T17:56Z,"I read a lot of comments here with subtitle-issues...

Why is it that when I play this file w/media player it doesn't play with subtitles? I ask this because it plays so much better w/media player on my system. Just no subs.

Thanks aol for this upload. One of the best I've seen so far."

Then get a better pc;) and if u have a good gpu use media player classic home cinema, it uses gpu to decode hd;)

Even my lg optimus x2 phone can play this when i convert it to mp4;)"
,since1876,2011-05-20T18:21Z,"People need to realize that 1920x1080 needs A LOT of video and processor power to run smoothly. If the video is slow, go download a lower quality rip. Those little 1gb rips will still look good on 99% of computer monitors (not really great on big screen TVs, though)."

Lol dude, you can brag about your phone but after you converted it its no longer 1080p, so its kinda obvious that your phone will play it .....

Jeez some people are retarded

@since1876
You are right, the Divx rips are good enough if u watch 17""/24"" but everything above that its better to have the higher res versions. anyways i assume if u have a highres tv/monitor that you also have a good pc cause nobody uses highres screens for a pentium 4 xD

@robertification(myself)
What player do you use? I hope your not using WMP! Try using VLC.

How come it plays ""so much better"" with WMP? WMP sucks to play movies with honestly... Try using VLC and then click ""V"" on your keyboard, this obviously only works when the .srt(sub file) file is in the same directory and has the exact same name as the .MKV

,ChosenTorture,2012-03-01T01:31Z,I already have the YIFI 1080p copy of this movie. Can anyone advice me whether i should get this 10 GB print or not ? Is the quality difference between the YIFI 1080p and AMIABLE 1080p noticeable or not ? Thanks !! :)
,lattari,2012-03-14T15:57Z,Assuming Yifu is the one uploading 700 mb highres movies than yes you might find seeing the outlines of characters as 'eyeopening'.
,AicheBow,2012-06-09T23:28Z,11 GB file and no sample. Great.
