|IsoBuster 2.8.0.0 Final + Key-[HB]|
+----------------------------------+

IsoBuster is an award winning , highly specialized and easy to use CD and DVD data recovery tool. It supports all CD and DVD formats and all common CD and DVD file-systems... Rescue lost files  from a bad or trashed CD or DVD disc, save important documents, precious pictures, video from the family, your only system backup.

Start up IsoBuster, Insert a CD or DVD, select the drive (if not selected already) and let IsoBuster mount the media. IsoBuster immediately shows you all the tracks and sessions located on the media, combined with all file-systems that are present. This way you get easy access, just like explorer, to all the files and folders per file-system. Instead of being limited to one file-system that the OS picks for you, you have access to "the complete picture". Access data from older sessions, access data that your OS (e.g. Windows) does not see or hides from you etc.

Isobuster interprets CD image files, such as:

*.DAO (Duplicator), *.TAO (Duplicator), *.ISO (Nero, BlindRead, Creator), *.BIN (CDRWin), *.IMG (CloneCD), *.CCD (CloneCD) , *.CIF (Creator), *.FCD (Uncompressed), *.NRG (Nero), *.GCD (Prassi), *.P01 (Toast), *.C2D (WinOnCD), *.CUE (CDRWin), *.CDI (DiscJuggler), *.CD (CD-i OptImage), *.GI (Prassi PrimoDVD), *.PXI (PlexTools), *.MDS (Alcohol), *.MDF (Alcohol), *.VC4 (Virtual CD), *.000 (Virtual CD), *.B5T (BlindWrite), *.B5I (BlindWrite), *.DMG (Apple Macintosh), *.IBP (IsoBuster), *.IBQ (IsoBuster), *.NCD (NTI).

And the list continues ...
* All device access, media access, data gathering and interpretation is done exclusively by the software. It does not rely on Windows to provide or interpret the data and so can work completely independent from Windows' limitations.
* Better Error handling and several retry-mechanisms to aid you in getting the data anyway.
* The use of both generic and alternative ways to get to the data, get the best out of your CD/DVD-ROM drive.
* The use of primary and secondary file-systems to get to the data and/or make use of file system data that might be ignored or â€˜forgottenâ€™ by popular OS. Explore the alternatives.
* CDs stay 'readable' after problems (such as Buffer Under-run, ...)
* Read / Extraction from open sessions.
* All sessions, including older ones, are accessible and can be recovered.

* Find lost movies created and saved to CD,DVD, BD or HD DVD, with Hitachi, other digital cameras or other devices with embedded UDF write functionality.
* Auto find extensions based on file content to try and give an appropriate name to an orphaned file. This built in file identifier assigns the proper extension to the file so that Windows applications can open the file. Only needed for orphaned files without a name.
* Support for Mount Rainier CD-RW and DVD+RW discs in MRW compatible and non-MRW compatible drives. Auto detection and automatic remapping which can be switched off or forced at all times. Built in MRW remapper / reader. (Built in Method 3 remapper)
